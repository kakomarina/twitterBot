It doesn't matter, if I were willing
It doesn't matter that the lights are dimmed down low
Oh, oh
I know you have to go
It doesn't matter, I fought my heart
It's broken, shattered to a million and one
Undone, I guess I haven't won

Cause I could've been your girl
And you could've been my four leaf clover
If I could do it over
I'd send you the pillow that I cry on

It doesn't matter, I just begun
And if you see me, just move on
Cause we are free and never meant to be


Cause I could've been your girl
And you could've been my four leaf clover
If I could do it over
I'd send you the pillow that I cry on

Cause I could've been your girl
And you could've been my four leaf clover
If I could do it over
I'd send you the pillow that I cry on

Cause I could've been your girl
And you could've been my four leaf clover
If I could do it over
I'd send you the pillow that I cry on
