Save me
I've been drinking wine
And I just made a big mistake
Happens all the time
Slay me
Come out from the dark
Saw myself on television
Different kind of art

We'll be okay
We'll be okay, ah

We've got the time
Gonna work its worth
And find the perfect crime
You don't need to know
What everybody's thinking
Don't get mad at yourself
Find it on the television

Lately
Think I've had enough
Of generation information every station
And I can't turn it off
So baby
Why you look so sad?
You've been trying too hard
Too hard to be happy
Where's the sense in that?

We'll be okay
We'll be okay, ah

We've got the time
Gonna work its worth
And find the perfect crime
You don't need to know
What everybody's thinking
Don't get mad at yourself
Find it on the television
Outside the line
Oh, come to me my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize
For every little thing we've made
I'm addicted to you
I've made bad decisions


Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation

We've got the time
Gonna work its worth
And find the perfect crime
You don't need to know
What everybody's thinking
Don't get mad at yourself
Find it on the television
Outside the line
Oh, come to me my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize
For every little thing we've made
I'm addicted to you
I've made bad decisions
