Down in Bowery they lose their ballads
And their lipped-mouths in the night
And stumbling through the street, they say
"Sir, do you got a light?"
And if you do, then you're my friend
And if you don't, then you're my foe
And if you are a deity of any sort,
Then please don't go

Ne me quitte pas, mon cher, ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher, ne me quitte pas

Down on Lexington they're waiting
You should stuck to aging feet
And close their eyes and open
And not recognize the aging street
And think about the things, we're right
When they were young and veins were tight
And if you are the Ghost of Christmas Past
Then won't you stay the night?

Ne me quitte pas, mon cher, ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher, ne me quitte pas
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher, ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher, ne me quitte pas


Down in Bronxy Bronx the kids go sledding
Down snow covered slopes
And frozen noses, frozen toes
The frozen city starts to glow
And, yes, they know it will melt
And, yes, they know New York will thaw
But if you're a friend of any sort
Then play along and catch a cold

Ne me quitte pas, mon cher, ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher, ne me quitte pas
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher, ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher, ne me quitte pas

I love Paris in the rain
I love Paris in the rain
I love, I love, in the rain
I love Paris in the rain
I love Paris in the rain
I love, I love, in the rain
I love, I love, in the rain
I love, I love, in the rain
I love, I love, in the rain
