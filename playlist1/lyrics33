Remember once things you told me
And how the tears ran from my eyes
They didn't fall because it hurt me
I just hate to see you cry

Sometimes I wish we could be strangers
So I didn't have to know your pain
But if I kept myself from danger
This empty news would feel the same

I ain't no angel
I never was
But I'd never hurt you
It's not my fault
Do you see those eggshells?
They're broken up
A million pieces
Strung out across the ground

Did you ever really love her?
Or was it that you left letting go
You should have known that you could trust her
But you pretend like I don't know


I ain't no angel
I never was
But I'd never hurt you
It's not my fault
Do you see those eggshells?
They're broken up
A million pieces
Strung out across the ground

I want to tell you I'm sorry
But that's not for me to say
You can have my heart, my soul, my body
If you can promise not go away

I ain't no angel
I never was
But I'd never hurt you
It's not my fault
Do you see those eggshells?
They're broken up
A million pieces
Strung out across the ground
