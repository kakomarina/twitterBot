Do you wish you hadn't stayed all night?
Do you wish you hadn't go so high?
Do you wish you hadn't come?
Oh no, gotta go

Do you wish it wasn't half past gone?
Do you wish it didn't last that long?
Do you wish you hadn't come?
Oh no, gotta go. Gotta run

Oh may I remind you?
May I remind you that you've got nowhere to go?
So I'm staying beside you
I'm staying beside you 'til you find our way back home

We're coming home
We're coming home
Light a fire
We're coming home
We'll write it down
We'll write it all down

And we dance along the finest line
Between the chance of time of our lives
And wishing you were done
Oh no, gotta run

And we're choosing not to make that choice
And we lose our shoes and voice
But we had a lot of fun
On the way, wanna play, gonna come?

Oh may I remind you?
May I remind you that you've got nowhere to go?
So I'm staying beside you
I'm staying beside you 'til you find our way back home


We're coming home
We're coming home
Light a fire
We're coming home
We'll write it down
We'll write it all down

We're coming home
We're coming home
Light a fire
We're coming home
We'll write it down
We'll write it all down

Then it all comes flooding back to me
Like a forgotten melody from a dream
Then it all comes flooding back to me
Like a forgotten melody from a dream
Then it all comes flooding back to me
Like a forgotten melody from a dream

We're coming home
We're coming home
Light a fire
We're coming home
We'll write it down
We'll write it all down
