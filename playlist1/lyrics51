Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision
Something of my own creation
I wake up alone
With only daylight between us
Last night the world was beneath us
Tonight comes, too long
We'll be torn apart
By the break of day
You're more than I can believe
Would ever come my way

Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision
Something of my own creation
Come via light
Why do I refuse you?
Cause if my fear's right
I risk to lose you
And if I just mind
And wake up alone
Bring on the night


Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision
Something of my own creation
And it's certainly
How am I to tell?
I know your face all too well
Still I wake up alone

Fiction when we're not together
