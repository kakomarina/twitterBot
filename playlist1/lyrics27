Untame me
It's not my midnight yet
Act like a wolf but think like a sheep (Wall Street)
Untame me
Cause this is my best advice
We're gonna give it back to you, some other day

Take off from the runway
Thinking of a sad day
Racing down the highway
Looking at me sideways

What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?

Untame me, it's time
I know the way uptown
Unchain me
I've waited for the time
To get you with your pajamas on

Take off from the runway
Thinking of a sad day
Playing with the new toys
Looking at the sad boys

What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?


And we take what we hide from them
And then say
"What do you want from me? "

The way, somewhere
Way to know
Anyway, to know
The same way to know
The way for some
And the devil may show
Away, somewhere
My love, get it in your head
Get out of your
?
?

What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side are you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?

Ohh
