Don't pull your pants before I go down
Don't turn away, this is my time
Don't make demands, I don't take none
Just say a prayer that it gon' get done

Don't pull your pants before I go down
Don't turn away, this is my time
Like a shotgun needs an outcome
I'm your prostitute, you gon' get some
Like a shotgun needs an outcome
I'm your prostitute, you gon' get some

Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no harm
Go ahead, go way low in my honey lovin' arms
Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no wrong
Got you around my finger like a lonely lover's charm
(Like a lonely lover's charm)

And 'cause I can, I'm gon' go west
Just like a man, I'm the fortress
Like a shotgun, I can't be outdone
I'm your prostitute, you gon' get some
Like a shotgun needs an outcome
I'm your prostitute, you gon' get some


Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no harm
Go ahead, go way low in my honey lovin' arms
Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no wrong
Got you around my finger like a lonely lover's charm

Go ahead, go
Go ahead, go
Go ahead, go
Go ahead, go
Go ahead, go
Go ahead, go
Go ahead
Eh!

Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no harm
Go ahead, go way low in my honey lovin' arms
Go ahead, go way low, where I can do no wrong
Got you around my finger like a lonely lover's charm
(Like a lonely lover's charm)
