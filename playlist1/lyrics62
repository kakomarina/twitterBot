See those birds go across the sky
Three thousand miles they fly
How do they know which way to go?
Somehow they always seem to know

They say there's mother nature nature in everything we see
I wish I had a little mother nature in me
Wish I had a little mother nature in me

'Cause it's not right, I'm magnetised
To somebody that don't feel it
Love paralyzed, just never gonna need me
But sure as the world keeps the moon in the sky
She'll keep me hanging on
She'll keep me hanging on

See the couple lying on the bus
Falling asleep with so much trust
I wish I had a chance to let them know
Their love is like a flower in the snow

If it's just pheromones that may be
I wish I had a little pheromones for me
I wish I had a little pheromones for me


'Cause it's not right
I am magnetised to somebody that don't feel it
Love paralyzed
I know you never gonna need me
I'm sure as the world keeps the moon in the sky
She'll keep me hanging on
She'll keep me hanging on
She'll keep me hanging on
North to south, white to black
When you love someone that don't love you back

It's not right, I'm magnetised
To somebody that don't feel it
Love paralyzed, just never gonna need me
But sure as the world keeps the moon in the sky
She'll keep me hanging on
She'll keep me hanging on
She'll keep me hanging on
She'll keep me hanging on
