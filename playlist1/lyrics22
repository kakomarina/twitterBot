Gimme out
Gimme in
I'd give you everything i could give
You try to take
And you try to make
But take on everything you can't break
If you go so easily
Go on, get out when you leave
But i'll wait
I won't wait till day you beg again
Let me out
Let me in
I've given up
Not given in
'cause together we are not one
We are nothing but holding on and on
Together now, forever then
Go ahead
Don't you let me in
But i will wait
I won't wait till day you beg again
Let me go
You know i'm not the one for leaving
Let me go
You know i'm nothing without your love
I know i'm nothing without your love
So let me go
You know i'm not the one for leaving
Let me go
You know i'm nothing without your love
I know i'm nothing without your love
So please go, go!
