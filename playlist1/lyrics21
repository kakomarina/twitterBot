I know a man with nothing in his hands
Nothing but a rolling stone
He told me about when his house burnt down
He lost everything he owned
He lay asleep for six hole weeks
They were gonna ask his mother to choose
When he woke up with nothing he said I'll tell you something
When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose
Now I've got a hole in my pocket, a hole in my shirt
A whole lot of trouble, he said
But now the money's gone, life carries on
And I miss it like a hole in the head

I know a woman with kids around her ankles
An a baby on her lap
She said one day her husband went to get a paper
And the mother fucker never came back
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise
Keeping the wolf from the door
She said the wolf's just a puppy
And the door's double locked
So why you gotta worry me for
Now he left a hole in my heart a hole
In a promise a hole on the side of my bed
Oh but now that he's gone well life carries on
And I miss him like a hole in the head


Well sometimes you can't change and you can't choose
And sometimes it seems you gain less than you lose
Now we've got holes in our hearts
Yeah we've got holes in our lives
Well we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on

Well we've got holes in our hearts
Yeah we've got holes in our lives
Well we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on
Said we've got holes in our hearts
Yeah we've got holes in our lives
Well we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on

Said we've got holes in our hearts
We've got holes in our lives
We've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on

Said we've got holes in our hearts
We've got holes in our lives
We've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on
Said we've got holes in our hearts
Yeah we? ve got holes in our lives
Well we? ve got holes, we? ve got holes but we carry on
