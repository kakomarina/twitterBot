Angus
Yeah, I seen you there
Looking all pretty when you brush your hair
Yeah, I like it when you smile
Won't you stay with me, just for a little while?

Angus e Julia
Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
We can go anywhere you want to go
Can I take you high to the mountain sky?
We can go as far as you want to go

Angus
Sitting here now beneath them stars
Makes me wanna take them wings to my arms
She's got this way
She's got this way
Of wrapping her little heart around mine


Angus e Julia
Can I take you home?
Can I take you home?
We can go anywhere you want to go
Can I take you high to the mountain sky?
We can go as far as you want to go
