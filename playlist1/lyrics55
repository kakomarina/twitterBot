Bed, stay in bed
The feeling of your skin locked in my head
Smoke, smoke me broke
I don't care I'm down for what you want

Day drunk into the night
Wanna keep you here
'Cause you dry my tears
Yeah summer love and then fights
How it is for us
And it's all because

Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one
So put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We fuck for life
On and on and on

Love, give me love
Anything you want, I'll give it up
Lips, lips I kiss
Bite me while I taste your fingertips

Day drunk into the night
Wanna keep you here
'Cause you dry my tears
Yeah summer love and then fights
How it is for us
And it's all because


Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one
So put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We fuck for life
On and on and on

Bodies, our baby making bodies
We just use for fun
Bodies, let's use them up
'Till every little piece is gone
On and on and on
On and on

Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one
So put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
We fuck for life
On and on and on
