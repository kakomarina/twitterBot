Mad mad mad

I...
I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness
Is starting to evolve, mmmm

And I...
I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness
Is swallowing me whole
Yeah

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you mean
Now,
I need to know is this real love
Or is it just madness
Keeping us afloat, mmmm

When I look back, at all the crazy fights we had
It's like some kind of madness
Was taking control, yeah

Now I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you need


Mad mad mad

Now I have finally seen the end (finally seen the end)
And I'm...
Not expecting you to care, no
(expecting you to care)
That I have finally seen the light (finally seen the light)
And I have finally realised (realised)

I need your love
I need your love

Come to me
Just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes, I know
I can't be wrong
And baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is...

Mad mad mad

Madness
