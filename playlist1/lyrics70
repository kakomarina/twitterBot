[Chorus 1]
Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather
Then I heard they slept together
Oh! the less I know the better
The less I know the better

[Verse 1]
Oh! my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh! my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

[Chorus 2]
She said it's not now or never
Wait 10 years, we'll be together
I said: "Better late than never"
Just don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever


[Verse 2]
Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind

[Outro]
I was doing fine without ya, 'til I saw your face, now I can't erase it
Giving in to all this bullshit
Is this what you want? Is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya, 'til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh! sweet darling where he wants you?
Said: "Come on superman, say your stupid line"
Said: "Come on superman, say your stupid line"
Said: "Come on superman, say your stupid line"
