Another conversation with no destination
Another battle never won
Each side is a loser
So who cares who fired the gun

And I'm learning so I'm leaving
And even though I'm grieving
I'm trying to find a meaning
Let loss reveal it
Let loss reveal it

St Jude, the patron saint of the lost causes
St Jude, we were lost before she started
St Jude, we lay in bed
as she whipped around us
St Jude
Maybe I've always been more comfortable in chaos

And I was on the island and you were there too
But somehow through the storm
I couldn't get to you
Oh St Jude, somehow she knew
And she came to give her blessing
While causing devastation
And I couldn't keep my mouth shut,
I just had to mention
Grabbing your attention


St Jude, the patron saint of the lost causes
St Jude, we were lost before she started
St Jude, we lay in bed
As she whipped around us
St Jude
Maybe I've always been more comfortable in chaos

St Jude
St Jude
St Jude
St Jude

And I'm learning, so I'm leaving
And even though I'm grieving
I'm trying to find the meaning
Let loss reveal it
Let loss reveal it

And I'm learning, so I'm leaving
And even though I'm grieving
I'm trying to find the meaning
Let loss reveal it
Let loss reveal it
