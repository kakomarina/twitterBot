Come down from where you are and get down
We are what we are not, we are found
to the sounds of the bells and the guns
we've taken all our vows, we are found

come on get down. Come on get down
make amends, make a vow
come on get down. Come on get down
mighty you, here now

so come on honey blow yourself to pieces
come on honey give yourself completely
and do it all although you can't believe it

youth knows no pain (2x)

come together and join the parade
and get back what got lost in the trade
with our crowns and our shimmering beads
with the wind in my hair, we are free

come on get down. Come on get down
make amends, make a vow
come on get down. Come on get down
mighty you, here now


so come on honey blow yourself to pieces
come on honey give yourself completely
and do it all although you can't believe it

youth knows no pain (2x)

I said youth don't know
youth knows no pain
I said youth don't know
youth knows no pain

so come on honey blow yourself to pieces
come on honey give yourself completely
come on honey blow yourself to pieces
come on honey give yourself completely
and do it all although you can't believe it

youth knows no pain (2x)
