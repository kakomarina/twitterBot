There's a place I can go
Where the rides never close
Come on down
It's a barrel of fun
Spinning round till I'm numb
On this merry-go-round

Going riding- riding- riding from me

Anyone can see
That I've had too much to dream
I'm singing till I'm screaming
Dancing till I'm bleeding
A cruel reality
When you've had too much to dream
Better keep your eyes shut
Cause you don't wanna wake up

Through the mouth of a clown
Take the zipper, go down
What a thrill
All the cocktails are pink
Wet your lips, you can drink
Till you get your fill


Going riding- riding- riding from me

Anyone can see
That I've had too much to dream
Im singing till I'm screaming
Dancing till I'm bleeding
A cruel reality
When you've had too much to dream
Better keep your eyes shut
Cause you don't wanna wake up

Ooh, everybody's waiting
For the curtain call
Ooh, I'm the fool who's busy
Singing to them all

Anyone can see
That I've had too much to dream
Im singing till I'm screaming
Dancing till I'm bleeding
A cruel reality
When you've had too much to dream
Better keep your eyes shut
Cause you don't wanna wake up
