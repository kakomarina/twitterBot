I got two diamonds and a feather
Gimme three reasons why we ain't together
I push my body through the floor like
Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else

You're on the corner waiting for my love
I put two walls behind you just to lean on
You're gonna need em cuz I stood you up
Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else

Cuz I fuck with myself more than anybody else
(It's all love)
I used to care what you think about me
(It's all love)
Cause my love so good
So I fuck with myself more than anybody else

I caught you fishing through the fodder
This whole relationship is under water
You're facing ages in your third strike
Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else


Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else
(It's all love)
I used to care what you think about me
(It's all love)
Cause my love so good
So I fuck with myself more than anybody else

I used to have a nickel for what you say, baby
Your words would burn me in the third degree
Now baby look what it's come to
Cause my love is the one
My love is the one

So I fuck with myself more than anybody else
(It's all love)
I used to care what you think about me
(It's all love)
Cause my love so good
So I fuck with myself more than anybody else
