Ahh, ahh
I wanna be on the front line
Nodding up suit ties
Talking like a headstrong mamma
Got a picture in your wallet
Making me a habbit wearin' your vintage t-shirt
Tied ribbons on your top pad
Tellin' me I'm all that
Just like the girls from your hometown
Sweet blooded and up-stranded
See if I can stand it
Drinking in the shallow water

Magnetic everything about you
You really got me, now
You did to me so well
Hypnotic taking over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talking in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean dug so deep
Hypnotic taking over me

Ahh, aahh
White threads on my laces
Struck on the hinges
Swinging the door to the back yard
'Cause dwellers walk a tight rope
Spot like a bandage touch on the outer surface
Bright eyes of the solstice
Wherever your mind is heading
From a freight train city
Locked up till you moon it
Brushing my hair back
Feeling your lips on my cold neck


Magnetic everything about you
You really got me, now
You did to me so well
Hypnotic taking over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talking in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean dug so deep
Hypnotic taking over me
Hypnotic taking over me

You do to me so well
Hypnotic taking over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talking in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean dug so deep
Hypnotic taking over me
Hypnotic taking over me
Hypnotic taking over me
Ahh, ahh
