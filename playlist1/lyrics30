When you're happy from a dream
Is it hard to work out what's real
Is the real over there
More vivid than here ever feels
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh other side
But inside love, you will be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Got covered, reason term
But it'll bring you up
You will be alright
You will be alright

It's a black pool, bright light
Brighter than the light in your home
Well, you want to be loved
But nobody else seems to know
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh other side
But inside love, you will be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Got covered, reason term
But it'll bring you up
You will be alright


We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody
We're all looking for somebody
We're all looking for somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh other side
But inside love, you will be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Got covered, reason term
But it'll bring you up
You will be alright

Sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet love
