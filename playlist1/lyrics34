Girl
Girl
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Walking up and down the hall
Frankie and his third lover
Speaking all the words she wants to hear
But that don't mean forever

Girl
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me
Girl
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Sitting down by the fire
Frankie plays the guitar
To people playing make believe
They say, "Can we get a little higher? "

You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
So easy baby
But I can't stand
An hour break
Another day
So let me make it easy babe

And it goes on and on and on and on
On and on and on

Packing her bags
She found somewhere to stay
And in the car to the station
You know the world looks a little brighter
And then there's no need for conversation
Tell me why

You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
You give it away
So easy baby
But I can't stand
An hour break
Another day
So let me make it easy babe


And it goes
Girl
You say you need someone to love you

Girl
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Girl
So I forgive and forget you
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Girl
So I forgive and forget you
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Girl
So I forgive and forget you
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Girl
So I forgive and forget you
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

Girl
So I forgive and forget you
You say you need someone to love you
But it ain't me

So I forgive and forget you
