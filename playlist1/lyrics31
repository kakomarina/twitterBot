Bite your face to spite your nose
17 and a half years old
I'm worrying about my brother finding out
Where's the fun in doing what you're told?

I said 'no! '
Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned 18 year old
'Give me a night I'll make you
I know you're looking for salvation
In the secular age
But girl I'm not your savior'
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around?

I said "Yo, I think I better go. I can't take you"
"You just sit and get stoned with 30 year olds
And you think you've made it"
"Well, shouldn't you be fucking
With somebody your age instead of making changes? "
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls


I told her from the start
Destined to be hard
I told her from the start
I'm breaking your heart
Destined to be hard
I'll break your heart

I said "Yo, I think I better go. I can't take you"
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But girl I'm not your savior
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody
Your age instead of making changes?
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

Because they're just girls

Just girls
Just girls
Just girls
