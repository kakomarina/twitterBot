Don't know what to say to you now
Standing right in front of you
Don't know how to fade in and out
Don't know how to play it cool
Losing a little guard, let it down
We don't have to think it through
We've got to let go

I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low
and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love

Tried to call you, to feel you close
From a runway in Tokyo
Let's leave the atmosphere, disappear
There's always something left to loose

But I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low
and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love
I wanna give you wild love


(I wanna give you wild love)
(I wanna give you wild love)
Let's be reckless, unaffected
Running out until we're breathless
Let's be hopeful, don't get broken
And stay caught up in the moment

But I wanna give you wild love
The kind that never slows down
I wanna take you high up
Let our hearts be the only sound
I wanna go where the lights burn low
and you're only mine
I wanna give you wild love
I wanna give you wild love

Give you wild love
Wild love
Wild love
Wild love
