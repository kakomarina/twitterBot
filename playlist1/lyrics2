Walk little walk
Small talk, big thoughts
Gonna tell them all just what I want
That street two streets I see you and me
Hanging on the empty of swings
'Count high low don't worry my eyes are closed
I'm a superman and it's my show
One shoe two gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm going to kick until I need new shoes

Yeah, Yeah
I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things

I run, they run everybody run run
And we're all just having fun
Sleigh ride, boat ride, piggy back ride
I'm going to show them all how I can ride
One, two, three close your eyes and count to four
I'm going to hide behind my bedroom door
Crayons on the wall, I'll color on them all
I'll draw until I've broken every law


Yeah, Yeah
I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Giving me things

Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop...

Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop don't stop don't stop
Giving me things
Stop don't stop don't stop
Laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop

I said uh, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
I said uh, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
I said uh, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
With me
