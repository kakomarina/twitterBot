How long has it been
Since you've fell in love with a boy like me?

When you drop 6 bottles of your best perfume,
And turn them into 12
Standing on the shoulders that are slating you
I slay them all myself

Your last order of your cheapo wine has never helped your case,
I'll come running with a crate of champagne,
To brighten up your face

So don't call me crazy,
Cause its all for you lady!

... try hard girl
Without you I see a little world
I'll come runnin' when the wind don't make a chime

Let's find particular words in the song that I sing,
Like the rock the paper, the scissors that sort of thing
The question is waiting in the pretty scene (how long has it been?)

So don't call me crazy,
Cause its all for you lady!

I'll come runnin', I'll come runnin',
When the wind don't make a chime
I'll come runnin', I'll come runnin',
When the wind don't make a chime
Don't make a chime but for me and you
