I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down

And three words have
Two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in the cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken then I will mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm
That's raging on now

I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up
When you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you anytime
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in

If things go right
We could frame it
And put you on a wall

And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up
When you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now


I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you anytime
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

And it's dark in the cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broke then I will mend ya
And keep you sheltered from the storm
That's raging on now

I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up
When you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight
I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you anytime
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch
I'm out of love
I'll pick you up
When you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now
