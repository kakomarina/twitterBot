If you weren't born with it
You can buy a couple ornaments
Just be sure to read the warning kids
'Cause pretty soon you'll be bored of it
(Ha, ha)

Sexual Hey girl, if you wanna feel sexual
You can always call up a professional
They stick pins in you like a vegetable
(Ha, ha)


Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic, it's only some plastic
No one will love you if you're unattractive


Oh, Mrs. Potato Head tell me
Is it true that pain is beauty?
Does a new face come with a warranty?
Will a pretty face make it better?
Oh, Mrs. Potato Head tell me
How did you afford her surgery?
Do you swear you'll stay forever?
Even if her face don't stay together
(Even if her face don't stay together)

If you want a little more confidence
Potatoes turn to french fries, yeah,
It's common sense
All you need's a couple more condiments
And a hundred thousand dollars
For some compliments
(Ha, ha)

It's such a waste
When little girls grow
Into their mothers face
But little girls are learning
How to cut and paste
And pucker up their lips until they suffocate
(Ha, ha)


Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic, it's only some plastic
No one will love you if you're unattractive

Oh, Mrs. Potato Head tell me
Is it true that pain is beauty?
Does a new face come with a warranty?
Will a pretty face make it better?
Oh, Mrs. Potato Head tell me
How did you afford her surgery?
Do you swear you'll stay forever?
Even if her face don't stay together


Oh, Mrs. Potato Head tell me

Oh, Mrs. Potato Head tell me
How did you afford her surgery?
Do you swear you'll stay forever?
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
