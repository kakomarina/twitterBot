When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
When they break it down and this world is all you know
Hands up, you're waving it 'round
Now get yourself together
When you count the dominos fall, it's time to go

Now I'm feeling so far away
I see the colors and all the kids going home
Night is crawling into the day
I hear my voice ringing
The summertime's singing

Just wanna stay up all night with you
Just wanna stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
Just wanna stay up all night with you

I'll keep it moving
Don't wait for nothing now
Gotta keep it moving
Don't wait for nothing now
I'll keep it moving
Don't wait, don't wait for nothing now
Gotta keep it moving
Don't wait for nothing now, nothing now

1, 2, what you doing?
I've been jumping through some hoops
Wanna get my body loose
Wanna tell you, tell you what to do
I've been running out of breath like an animal struggling
Looking for a diamond
I'm trying, I'm fighting
Back into the rhythm now


I just wanna stay up all night
Wanna stay up all night with you
With you, you

Just wanna stay up all night with you (wanna stay up all night)
Just wanna stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do (than stay up all night)
Just wanna stay up all night with you

Hands up in the air
If you don't really care
Living don't get you there
If you got the climb to take it up there
Hands up in the air
Living out on a prayer
Living don't get you there
Nothing that I want but rather be there
