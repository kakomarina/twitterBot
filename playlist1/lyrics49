I feel the four become five
And I'm waiting, waiting, waiting
For you to walk down the boulevard
And to take me, take me, take me
But the moment you appear
You wake me, wake me, wake me
Out of the slumbers of my head
From the slums of loneliness

And there's no conspiracy
Behind the way to hearts meet
When love is a two way street
And I think I'm ready
To let you get under my skin
I can't make you fall for me
Love is a two way street

We're coming close to our flame
They'll put a star beside our names
But I couldn't care for the history
When I've got you in front of me
The cars could all collide
The shards of glass won't catch my eye
Because you're almost by my side
We're counting down at the green light


And there's no conspiracy
Behind the way to hearts meet
When love is a two way street
And I think I'm ready
To let you get under my skin
I can't make you fall for me
Love is a two way street

And there's no conspiracy
Behind the way to hearts meet
When love is a two way street
And I think I'm ready
To let you get under my skin
I can't make you fall for me
Love is a two way street
