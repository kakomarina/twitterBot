Let's not make this complicated, I know you
Last night I had the strangest dream that you knew me too
But you need to wake up
I can't have you disappear
Just like my parents' house
I've become a visitor
In the night you say, that you go underwater
You won't take me, no
You won't drown with your lover
You told me I wasn't available
I guess I wasn't, I wasn't capable
I want to better this time
But I guess you're better in the back of my mind
Oh you need to wake up
I can't have you disappear
Just like my parents' house
I've become a visitor
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
(Hey stop, you're doing this again)
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
(Hey stop, you're doing this again)
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
(Hey stop, you're doing this again)
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed (ooh, ooh)
(Hey stop, you're doing this again)
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
