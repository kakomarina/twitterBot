Two nights ago
She got that look in her eyes
Kaleidoscope, but that's only half the time
Three days before
She told me that I don't even try
She's crazy, though
I guess there's something wrong inside
Maybe you're right
Maybe this is all that I can be
But what if it's you, and it wasn't me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Four weeks ahead
I thought that I should think some more
I'm fucked in the head, and my mind is turning into a whore
Five months go by
And I thought about letting her go
She's crazy, though
And I guess she took control
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Maybe you're right
Maybe this is all that I can be
But what if it's you, and it wasn't me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Maybe she's right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe we'll fight 'til it moves us along
I can't deny writing a song
Hoping she'll find she's not alone
Maybe you're right
Maybe this is all that I can be
But what if it's you, and it wasn't me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me now?
