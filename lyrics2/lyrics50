Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with her drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother
Run fast for your father
Run for your children
For your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love
And your longing behind
You can't carry it with you
If you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
Run fast for your mother
Run fast for your father
Run for your children
For your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love
And your longing behind
You can't carry it with you
If you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come (here they come)
The dog days are over
The dog days are done (here they come)
The horses are coming
So you better run
