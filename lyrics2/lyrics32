Help me when I'm at a loss for words
Bring up all of my memories for the please and the temporal
False lovin', when I was illogical
Didn't have each other hands as they made one whole
Brain stem, yours temperature
Rise now, sweat, it drops down my silky flesh
But during up my consciousness
Good, good, good now
Ability to sleep sound
Throughout the start times
An illusion, if you just remove it
When did humans start to separate
Brain and heart as if they could stay alive alone
Flip it around the other way
If they were apart and you had no powers
Start on no day, the base, only a shell remains
What fun is it, to bein' so calculated
Or be takin' advantage of, 'cause your heart's too trusting
Silent expressed push my head into my chest
Bind and look forever wet
Don't drift too far they said
Help me when I'm too detached and cold
Give me the vitality, identity, to trust love more
Blood to the water, now they can fuel us alone
Fragrance on my arteries, passion bloomin' through my bones
Heart strings trigger emotion streams
A God belongs, a journey where rivers connect all of me
But, but be a step and stone don't you disappoint me
Sometimes I think you're all I need, what's beyond belief
When did humans start to separate
Brain and heart as if they could stay alive alone
Flip it around the other way
If they were apart and you had no powers
Start on no day, the base, only a shell remains
What fun is it, to bein' so calculated
Or be takin' advantage of, 'cause your heart's too trusting
Silent expressed push my head into my chest
Bind and look forever wet
Don't drift too far they said
