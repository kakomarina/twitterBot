You cross this line
Do you find it hard to say it with me tonight?
I’ve walked these miles but I’ve walked in straight lines
You’ll never know what was there to be
Fine
I’m wasting my young years
It doesn’t matter here
I’m chasing more ideas
It doesn’t matter here
Baby, we are, we are
Maybe I’m wasting my young years
Baby, we are, we are
Maybe I’m wasting my young years
Don’t you know that it’s all I feel?
I wouldn’t worry, you have all the love
I’ve heard it takes some time to get it right
I’m wasting my young years
It doesn’t matter here
I’m chasing more ideas
It doesn’t matter here
Baby, we are, we are
Maybe I’m wasting my young years
Baby, we are, we are
Maybe I’m wasting my young years
I don’t know what you want
Don’t leave me hanging on
Don’t know what you want
Don’t leave me hanging on.
