Left with a black eye
That was the worst I've felt
In a long, long time
I caught a red eye
Back to the West side
In the Tobacco Sunburst sky
Looked in those brown eyes
Thought I found myself
Damn, it's been a while
Lookin' in your blue eyes
Never knew I'd lose myself
In the Tobacco Sunburst sky, I
I, I, ooh, woah
Oh I, ooh, woah
I'll turn a blind eye
Lookin' on the bright side now
Hell, I'll give you the try
Lookin' in your green eyes
Never knew I'd need your help
I don't want to wait any more time (any more time)
Watchin' those flames burn bright (burn bright)
I don't want to wait any more time (any more time)
Sick of watchin' those days roll on by
