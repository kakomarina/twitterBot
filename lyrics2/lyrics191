Looking up from underneath
Fractured moonlight on the sea
Reflections still look the same to me
As before I went under
And it's peaceful in the deep
Cathedral where you cannot breathe
No need to pray, no need to speak
Now I am under all
And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
I found the place to rest my head
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me
Though the pressure's hard to take
It's the only way I can escape
It seems a heavy choice to make
But now I am under all
And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
I found the place to rest my head
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me
And it's over and I'm goin' under
But I'm not givin' up
I'm just givin' in
Oh, slipping underneath
Oh, so cold but so sweet
In the arms of the ocean, so sweet and so cold
And all this devotion, I never knew it all
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner released
And the arms of the ocean delivered me
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Delivered me
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Delivered me
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
And it's over and I'm goin' under
But I'm not givin' up
I'm just givin' in
Oh, slipping underneath
Oh, so cold but so sweet
