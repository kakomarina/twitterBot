Sweet boy, straight out of the movie screen
Candy hearts and chocolate dreams
I met my prince upon popcorn bowl
He held my heart and let it go
Ice cream, upon a summers day
Beginning sweetness never stays
Melting through the cracks in my hands
I guess I held on for too long
I'm done with your bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun when I'm sitting all alone, you're right in front of me
I'm done with your bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun when I'm sitting all alone, you're right in front of me
(You're right in front of me)
You speak sour lemonade to me
The bitter taste won't let me be
One kiss was supposed to be so sweet
But I found grapefruit in your teeth
Old gum is all you'll ever be to me
I spit you out and brush my teeth
Melting through the cracks in my hands
I guess I held on for too long
I'm done with your bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun when I'm sitting all alone you're right in front of me
I'm done with your bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun when I'm sitting all alone you're right in front of me
(You're right in front of me)
Enough of your bittersweet, your sugar rots my teeth
Clogs up my arteries, your bittersweet shit is a tragedy
I'm done with your bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun when I'm sitting all alone you're right in front of me
I'm done with your bittersweet, bittersweet tragedy
It's no fun when I'm sitting all alone you're right in front of me
(You're right in front of me)
(You're right in front of me)
