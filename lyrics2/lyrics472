Oh, pretty baby, you're my motivator
Got me changing my words and my behavior
Pretty lady, you're my operator
Got me dialling your number just to hear ya
Tell me the things that you want
I give you all that I've got
Open your eyes, then you will see
It's just you and me
Only
Throwing out the key
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me
Only
Listen to you breathe
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me
My disaster, you're my only answer
You got me thinking that I could be your master
Pretty baby, you're my heavy ocean
Bring me down and give me your devotion
Tell me the things that you want (you want)
I give you all that I've got (I've got)
Open your eyes, then you will see
It's just you and me
Only
Throwing out the key
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me
Only
Listen to you breathe
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me
Take, take me over
Take me over
I don't wanna wake up
It's just you and me
Take, take me over
Take me over
I don't wanna wake up
It's just you and me
Dream, dream, dream, dream world
Dream, dream, dream, dream world
Take, take me over
Take me over
I don't wanna wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Listen to you breathe
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me
Only
Throwing out the key
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me
Dream, dream, dream, dream world
It's just you and me
Dream, dream, dream, dream world
Only
