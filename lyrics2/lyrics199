Broken bottles in the hotel lobby
Seems to me like I'm just scared of never feeling it again
I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
But is not that easy
I remember it now it takes me back to when it all first started
But I've only got myself to blame for it and I accept it now
It's time to let it go, go out and start again
But it's not that easy
But I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes
When you, let it go, go out and started again
High hopes
When it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning around
And in my dreams I meet the ghosts of all the people who've come and gone
Memories that seems to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon
Naive, I was just staring at the barrel of a gun
And I do believe that
Yeah, but I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes
When you, let it go, go out and started again
High hopes oh
When it all comes to an end
And the world keeps spinning
Yeah the world keeps spinning around
High hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes
When you, let it go, go out and started again
High hopes oh
And when the world keeps spinning around
Yeah is the world keeps spinning
How this world keeps spinning around
