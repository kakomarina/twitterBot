Be my mistake
Then turn out the light
She bought me those jeans
The ones you like
I don't wanna hug
I just wanna sleep
The smell of your hair
Reminds me of her feet
So, don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes
Save all the jokes you're gonna make
While I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake
I shouldn't have called
'Cause we shouldn't speak
You do make me hard
But she makes me weak
And don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes
Save all the jokes you're gonna make
While I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake
