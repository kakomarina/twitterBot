Cause I'm tired of all this talking
'Cause everything you hear is empty words
But who am I, oh to say this
'Cause everything you hear is just words, yeah
You have to trust in someone
Trust in someone
Trust in someone
'Cause the truth is
'Cause all I need, is to see you
Blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you
To blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And I'm tired, of constant sorrow
'Cause everything you get is just words
So what's the point, of going somewhere
When everyone you see
Is just nothing but confused
Have to trust in, someone trust in
Someone trust in someone 'cause the truth is
'Cause all I need, is to see you blossom out
Blossom out blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out
Blossom out blossom out
And all I need, is to see you blossom out
Blossom out blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out
Blossom out blossom out
Blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
Blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
'Cause all I need, is to see you blossom out
Blossom out blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out
Blossom out blossom out
To blossom out blossom out blossom out
To blossom out blossom out blossom out
