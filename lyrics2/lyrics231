So you told me to go
You said don’t turn around
There was no going back
Yeah, you said it
You were all out of love
Now you changing your mind
I forgive you, but I can’t forget it
We walked these roads too many times
I know the ropes and all your lines
If it’s over
Stop asking me to come back
Oh, stop asking me to do that
It’s like you’re waiting on a better man
And you break me all over again
Stop asking me to come back
I don’t wanna be friends
'Cause I’ll always want more
Let the end be the end
But go on just say it
Stop asking me to come back
Oh, stop asking me to do that
It’s like you're waiting on a better man
And you break me all over again
Stop asking me to come back
I can’t stay myself
I need your help
I need your help
We walked these roads too many times
I know your ropes and all your lines
If it’s over
Stop asking me to come back
Oh, stop asking me to do that
It’s like you're waiting on a better man
And you break me all over again
Stop asking me to come back
