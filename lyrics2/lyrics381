Where do you go with your broken heart in tow
What do you do with the left over you
And how do you know, when to let go
Where does the good go, where does the good go
Look me in the eye and tell me you don't find me attractive
Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go
Look me in the eye and promise no love's like our love
Look me in my heart and un break broken, it won't happen
It's love that leaves and breaks the seal of always thinking you'd be
Real, happy and healthy, strong and calm, where does the good go
Where does the good go
Where do you go when you're in love and the world knows
How do you live so happily while I am sad and broken down
What do you say it's up for grabs now that you're on your way down
Where does the good go, where does the good go
Look me in the eye and tell me you don't find me attractive
Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go
Look me in the eye and promise no love's like our love
Look me in my heart and un break broken, it won't happen
It's love that leaves and breaks the seal of always thinking you'd be
Real, happy and healthy, strong and calm, where does the good go
Where does the good go
Look me in the eye and tell me you don't find me attractive
Look me in the heart and tell me you won't go
Look me in the eye and promise no love's like our love
Look me in my heart and un break broken, it won't happen
It's love that leaves and breaks the seal of always thinking you'd be
Real, happy and healthy, strong and calm, where does the good go
Where does the good go
It's love that leaves and breaks the seal of always thinking you'd be
Real, happy and healthy, strong and calm, where does the good go
Where does the good go
Where does the good go
