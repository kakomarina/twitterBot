She'll lie and steal and cheat, and beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you the one you can't repair
But I still love her I don't really care
When we were young oh, oh we did enough
When it got cold ooh, ooh we bundled up
I can't be told ah, ah it can't be done
It's better to feel pain than nothing at all
The opposite of love's indifference
So pay attention now I'm standing on your porch screamin out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs
So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love
And I don't blame ya dear for running like you did all these years
I would do the same you best believe
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes
When we were young, oh, oh, we did enough
When it got cold, ooh, ooh, we bundled up
I can't be told, ah, ah, it can't be done
So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love
Head up, love
Head up, love
