Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I comin' outta left field?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like its 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with the babysitter
Mama call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I comin' outta left field?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might have had your fill, I can feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like its 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
Or we can wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But oh until it falls
Won't bother me
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Yeah my love is in abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like its 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Might have had your fill, I can feel it still
