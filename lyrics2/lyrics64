Wait 'til you’re announced
We’ve not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon your greatness and she'll send
The call out, send the call out
Call all the ladies out
They’re in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the Moon
The Moon, we love like a brother
While he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well
Even the comatose, they don’t dance and tell
We live in cities you'll never see on a screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn’t my fault
And everyone’s competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release
We live in cities you'll never see on a screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run free
Living in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team
I’m kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I’m kinda older than I was when I revelled without a care
So there
We live in cities you'll never see on a screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know
