Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know, chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I, feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
Come, come one, come all
You must be this tall
To ride this ride at the carnival
Oh, come, take my hand
And run through playland
So high, too high at the carnival
And it's all fun and games 'till somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket and there's no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know, chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I, feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
This horse is too slow
We're always this close
Almost, almost, we're a freakshow
Ride right when I'm near
It's like you disappear
Where'd you go?
Mr. Houdini, you're a freak show
And it's all fun and games 'till somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket and there's no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know, chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I, feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
Why did you steal my cotton candy heart?
You threw it in this damn coin slot
And now I'm stuck, I'm stuck
Riding, riding, riding
Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know, chasing after you is like a fairytale
But I, feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
