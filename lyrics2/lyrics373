Started in the strangest way
Didn't see it coming
Swept up in your hurricane
Wouldn't give it up for nothing
Now I'm all caught up in the highs and the lows
It's a shock to my system
I don't wanna run away, so I stay
My head gets messy when I try to hide
The things I love about you in my mind
I don't really know a lot about love
A lot about love, a lot about love
But you're in my head, you're in my blood
And it feels so good, it hurts so much
I don't really know a lot about love
A lot about love, a lot about love
But you're in my head, you're in my blood
And it feels so good, it hurts so much (so much)
Feels so good, it hurts so much
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
But you're in my head, you're in my blood
And it feels so good, it hurts so much
Think about the time it took for our paths to cross
Read me like an open book
I was found and lost
Now I'm all caught up in the highs and the lows
It's a shock to my system
I know that our love was fate, so I stay
My head gets messy when I try to hide
The things I love about you in my mind
I don't really know a lot about love
A lot about love, a lot about love
But you're in my head, you're in my blood
And it feels so good, it hurts so much
I don't really know a lot about love
A lot about love, a lot about love
But you're in my head, you're in my blood
And it feels so good, it hurts so much
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
But you're in my head, you're in my blood
And it feels so good, it hurts so much
My head gets messy when I try to hide
The things I love about you in my mind
I don't really know a lot about love
A lot about love, a lot about love
But you're in my head, you're in my blood
And it feels so good, it hurts so much
I don't really know a lot about love
A lot about love, a lot about love
But you're in my head, you're in my blood
And it feels so good, it hurts so much
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
But you're in my head, you're in my blood
And it feels so good, it hurts so much
