Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
With a bow tie ribbon, stop it
Eatin’ all the rainbow cookies
Pies are flying through the roof
Not my first pick but I’ll do it
Make the cash right so I can move quick
Out this shithole with a new whip
Cream on top and I’d approve it
Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
(Pack it, box it, flip it, top it)
Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
(Pack it, box it, flip it, top it)
My boss is Mother Mary
Catch me slippin’ through the concrete
Show no mercy, step right on me
Stiletto death, send me to purgatory
The bakery tryna make some more
They expect me to stay when I should go
Grab the bag for when they cross the door
It ain’t for me to roll it out
It’s just for me to raise the dough
Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
With a bow tie ribbon, stop it
Eatin’ all the rainbow cookies
Pies are flying through the roof
All the cherry, the way they all go
Knock ’em down like she a dodgeball
Little mess up and she’s angry
One downfall, she blamed the whole team
Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
(Pack it, box it, flip it, top it)
Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
(Pack it, box it, flip it, top it)
