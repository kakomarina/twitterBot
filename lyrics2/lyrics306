Lost and afraid young and innocent but getting older
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone
Sharper the blade is ,the easier it scars your soul
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone
My current state is heavy
Hope it's a phase or something
Don't let me go
Up and away, I'm an alien I need a moment
I don't know what to believe, all I wanna do is leave
What can I say that would make this seem, make you need me
Maybe I won't ever know, maybe I'll end up alone
Running in place
(Circles, in circles with you)
Don't mind me
Out in the rain, watch me go
I don't wanna let you down
So promise you wonâ€™t let me drown
How can you feel the way that I'm feeling
If you're not inside my head?
I got the pressure that's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
I got some mixed emotions
About how I'm handling the stress
I get off of it because of the money
It's making my tummy upset
I can feel the way that I'm feeling
The feeling inside my head
I got the pressure that's pushing my buttons
And making me think about death
Somebody find me and fast
Look what I did to myself and my friends
Emotions and paying the rent
Emotions and paying the rent
I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm hoping that I'm never sati
I'm hoping that I'm never satisfied
I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm hoping that I'm never sati
I'm hoping that I'm never satisfied
I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm hoping that I'm never sati
I'm hoping that I'm never satisfied
I'm back and forth, I think I'm going crazy
I'm back and forth, I can't make up my mind
I'm hoping that I'm never sati
I'm hoping that I'm never satisfied
