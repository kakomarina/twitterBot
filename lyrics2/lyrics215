Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck; some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore
This is it, boys, this is war, what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype, save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style
And that's alright; I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I?
Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win, I always win
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know
So this is it? I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
No. When I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like this one, so come on
Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on!
Well, that is it, guys, that is all, five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks back home; I'm sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?
My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she called "love"
But when I look into my nephews eyes...
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from...
Some terrible lies
The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree it's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance
