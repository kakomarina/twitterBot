Fighting, living, dying
For what?
For freedom
That's what which men have fought since time begun
To be free
They've been making blanked statements, scaring everyone
They've been making you feel like you never did belong
Yeah, he said, and she said, yeah, they said a lot
So many things, they just think you forgot
Who you are, and what you do, and where you're coming from
I just thought I could remind you with this simple song
Look at body language, can start to rebuff
To where we're using weapons, hatred, not love
Not you
You are in the wilderness, looking for your own purpose
And you became a butterfly, butterfly
I knew you always would
They were throwing sticks and stones
Words can never break your bones
You can spread your wings and fly, wings and fly
I knew you always would
I knew you always would
I knew there always was nothing wrong with being
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
All you ever see on CNN are enemys
Telling you to lose your individuality
Look, do this and do that, 'till you've lost your way
'Till you need to fight? Means of escape
They want you to stare into your screen and see yourself
Blow smoke into your mirror 'till you imagine your own world
So don't let them catch you with lies and deceit
They can't take your soul or your desire for freedom
You are in the wilderness, looking for your own purpose
And you became a butterfly, butterfly
I knew you always would
They were throwing sticks and stones
Words can never break your bones
You can spread your wings and fly, wings and fly
I knew you always would
I knew you always would
I knew there always was nothing wrong with being
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
Yeah, yeah
You said I'm wanna be
I'm gonna be everything they said I couldn't be
Everything that I said I would be when I picked up a pen and I started to speak
I hear the beat
My melody
And I just pour all my heart into these sheets
I cannot just be a star in the streets
Man, I knew what was different, I had that belief
Nowhere to live, nothing to eat
You were so hungry that you couldn't sleep
You couldn't breathe
I couldn't be
All this shit was happening to me
I would do drugs, I was a theft
Still on the run from the car of Police
You were the mission that was given to me, by the powers to be
You are in the wilderness, looking for your own purpose
And you became a butterfly, butterfly
I knew you always would
You are in the wilderness, looking for your own purpose
And you became a butterfly, butterfly
I knew you always would
They were throwing sticks and stones
Words can never break your bones
You can spread your wings and fly, wings and fly
I knew you always would
I knew you always would
I knew there always was nothing wrong with being
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
