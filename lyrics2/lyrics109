Where have you been?
Do you know when you're coming back?
'Cause since you've been gone
I've got along but I've been sad
I tried to put it out for you to get
Could've, should've but you never did
Wish you wanted it a little bit
More, but it's a chore for you to give
Where have you been?
Do you know if you're coming back?
We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Falling just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise (I sold my soul for you)
I see my reflection in your eyes
I know you're sick
Hoping you fix whatever's broken
Ignorant bliss
And a few sips might be the potion
I tried to put it out for you to get
Could've, should've but you never did
Wish you wanted in a little bit
More, but it's a chore for you to give
Where have you been?
Do you know if you're coming back?
We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Falling just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise (I sold my soul for you)
I see my reflection in your eyes (tell me you see it too)
So close, so close
Yet so far away (so far)
I don't know (I don't)
How to be solo (no)
So don't go, oh, no, just stay
You and I were bright, shooting through the sky daily (yeah)
Lighting up the night, wasn't always right, baby (mhm)
Yeah, every time that we realised it's crazy
And you save me
We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Falling just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise (I sold my soul for you)
I see my reflection in your eyes (I sold my soul for you, I know you see it too)
Yeah, I brought same ones too
I know you're tired, I know you're tired
Just say it, I agree with you
Yeah, sick of all the poison in me
What did I do wrong for me, babe?
Uh, I see myself in you, I see myself in you, baby
I see myself in you, alright, I sold my soul for you
Maybe you should too
