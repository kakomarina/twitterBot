We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them
And we can find out the information
Access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh, fuck your feelings
Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay
Modernity has failed us
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
And poison me, daddy
I got the jones right through my bones
Write it on a piece of stone
A beach of drowning 3 year olds
Rest in peace, Lil Peep
The poetry is in the streets
Jesus, save us!
Modernity has failed us
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
I'd love it if we made it
Tell me something I didn't know
Consultation, degradation
Fossil fuelling, masturbation
Immigration, Liberal kitsch
Kneeling on a pitch
I moved on her like a bitch
Excited to be indicted
Unrequited house with seven pools
Thank you, Kanye, very cool
The war has been incited
And guess what, you're all invited
And you're famous
Modernity has failed us
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
Tell me something I didn't know
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
