I'm not a bad guy
So don’t treat me bad if I'm feeling sad, alright?
Please don't be mad if I don’t smile back, alright?
If I fuck up my words, don't think I'm absurd, alright?
Alright?
I'm physically exhausted
Tired of my knuckles beating
I'm chewing gum to pass this time
Sadness, can't you see it?
You're too busy seeking selfish wishes
Look at how I'm feeling
You write me up and say it’s love
And I can’t believe it
Baby, can you meet me tonight in detention?
I can feel your blood pressure rise, fuck this tension
Let me crawl up into your mind, did I mention?
Pretending everything's alright is detention
De-detention
De-detention
Pretending everything’s all right is (shh)
The teachers don't care about me
Fuck how I feel, as long as I make money
They let them do whatever they want to me
They're the customer, I'm chopped meat
I’m chopped meat
I'm physically exhausted
Tired of my knuckles beating
I'm chewing gum to pass this time
Sadness, can't you see it?
You're too busy seeking selfish wishes
Look at how I'm feeling
You write me up and say it's love
And I can't believe it
Baby, can you meet me tonight in detention?
I can feel your blood pressure rise, fuck this tension
Let me crawl up into your mind, did I mention?
Pretending everything's alright is detention
De-detention
De-detention
Pretending everything's all right is detention
I wanna go home and you say: Now is not the time
Fuck being all alone in back of the classroom, ah
Stop calling up my phone, trying to say that I've been out of line
When all I ever asked was to go to the bathroom
Baby, can you meet me tonight in detention?
I can feel your blood pressure rise, fuck this tension
Let me crawl up into your mind, did I mention?
Pretending everything's alright is detention
Tonight, I can feel your blood pressure rise
Let me crawl up into your mind
Pretending everything's alright (is detention)
