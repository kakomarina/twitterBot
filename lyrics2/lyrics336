No, thank you
Is what I should've said
I should be in bed
But temptations
Of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come
One sip
Bad for me
One hit
Bad for me
One kiss
Bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you
Is how it shoulda gone
I should stay strong
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
(Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that)
No, thank you
They call me after dark
I don't want no part
My habits
They hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge
One sip
Bad for me
One hit
Bad for me
One kiss
Bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no, thank you
Is how it shoulda gone
I should stay strong
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
We, we fall for that
Wake up
We fall again
(Fall fall again fall fall fall)
We we fall for that
Can't wait to fall again
(Boy oh boy ua boy oh boy fall again)
One sip
Bad for me
One hit
Bad for me
One kiss
Bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you
Is how it shoulda gone
I should stay strong
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak go!
But I'm weak
And what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy, I love it when I fall for that
