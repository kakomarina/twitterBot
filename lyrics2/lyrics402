Been a while since I felt this way about someone
I'd really really like to know you, more
Oh oh, know you, more
Oh, your eyes, they sing a song to me
And I'd really really like to move to it, oh, groove, oh
And I will oh, open my heart
And I will oh, only for you
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh, yeah
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh
And I will, I I ohh, ooh
And I will, oh, only for you
And I just don't know what to do
My head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired of trying, ooh ooh ooh
And I just don't know what to do
My head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired of trying, ooh ooh ooh
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh ooh, yeah
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh, ooh
And I will open my heart
And I will oh, only for you
