You had your heart on your sleeve the last time
Took it so seriously the last time
Gave everybody a piece the last time
Yeah, you said it would be the last time
Oooh, yeah
If you find that silver lining
You shouldn't know what that means
You've been movin' fast
Splittin' at the seams
If you find that silver lining
You're already in deep
There's another piece that was buried underneath
You were out of your league the last time
Didn't expect 'em to see your bad sidе
You told 'em they could beliеve in you
Now you just gotta believe it too
Oooh, yeah
If you find that silver lining
You shouldn't know what that means
You've been movin' fast
Splittin' at the seams
If you find that silver lining
You're already in deep
This could be your last hope that might be all you need
If you find that silver lining
You're already in deep
This could be your last hope
