Find me here
And speak to me
I want to feel you
I need to hear you
You are the light
That's leading me
To the place
Where I find peace again
You are the strength
That keeps me walking
You are the hope
That keeps me trusting
You are the life
In to my soul
You are my purpose
You're everything
And how can I stand here with you
And not be moved by you?
Would you tell me how could it be
Any better than this? Yeah
You calm the storms
And you give me rest
You hold me in your hands
You won't let me fall
You steal my heart
And you take my breath away
Would you take me in?
Take me deeper now?
And how can I stand here with you
And not be moved by you?
Would you tell me how could it be
Any better than this?
And how can I stand here with you
And not be moved by you?
Would you tell me how could it be
Any better than this?
Cause you're all I want
You're all I need
You're everything, everything
You're all I want
You're all I need
You're everything, everything
You're all I want
You're all I need
You're everything, everything
You're all I want
You're all I need
Everything, everything
And how can I stand here with you
And not be moved by you?
Would you tell me how could it be
Any better than this?
And how can I stand here with you
And not be moved by you?
Would you tell me how could it be
Any better, any better than this?
And how can I stand here with you
And not be moved by you?
Would you tell me how could it be
Any better than this?
Would you tell me how could it be
Any better than this?
