Always aiming paper airplanes at me when you're around
You build me up like building blocks just so you can bring me down
You can crush my candy cane, but you'll never catch me cry
If you dangle that diploma and I dead you, don't be surprised
I know my A-B-C's
Yet you keep teaching me
I say fuck your degree
Alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me
With all your bad poetry
Fuck all your A-B-C's
Alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on a fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But, are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy
Apples aren't always appropriate apologies
Butterscotch and bubblegum drops are bittersweet to me
You call me a child while you keep counting all your coins
But you're not my daddy and I'm not your dolly and your dictionary's destroyed
I know my A-B-C's
Yet you keep teaching me
I say fuck your degree
Alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me
With all your bad poetry
Fuck all your A-B-C's
Alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on a fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But, are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy
Alphabet boy
Oh, alphabet boy
Alphabet boy
Oh, my
Alphabet boy
My alphabet boy
Oohhh
I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on a fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But, are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy
Alphabet boy
Oh, my
Alphabet boy
Alphabet boy
Ooh, yeah
Alphabet boy
