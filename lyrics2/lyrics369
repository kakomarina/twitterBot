I'm building this house on the moon
Like a lost astronaut
Looking at you like a star
From a place the world forgot
And there is nothing that I can do
Except bury my love for you
The brightness of the sun
Will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moon dust
I long to hear your voice
But still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moon dust
Nothing can breathe in this space
Colder than the darkest sea
I have dreams about the days
Driving through your sunset breeze
But the first thing that I will do
Is bury my love for you
The brightness of the sun
Will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moon dust
I long to hear your voice
But still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moon dust
I'm a cast-away and then reap what they sow
And I'll say what I know to be true, yeah
I'm living far away on the face of the moon
I've buried my love to give the world to you
The brightness of the sun
Will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moon dust
I long to hear your voice
But still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moon dust
I bury my love in the moon dust, yeah
