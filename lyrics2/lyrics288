Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said: You're holding back
She said: Shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said: Oh, oh, oh
Shut up and dance with me
We were victims of the night
The chemical, physical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the faded light
Oh, we were born to get together
Born to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said: You're holding back
She said: Shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said: Oh, oh, oh
Shut up and dance with me
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
My disco tec Juliet teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew we were born to be together
Born to be together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said: You're holding back
She said: Shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said: Oh, oh, oh
Shut up and dance with me
(Oh, come on, girl!)
Deep in her eyes
I think I see our future
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said: Shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said: Oh, oh, oh
Shut up and dance
Shut up and dance
Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said: Shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said: Oh, oh, oh
Shut up and dance with me
Oh, oh, oh, shut up dance with me
