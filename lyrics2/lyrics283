I've been feeling low, so low now
Tryna do my best, don't know how
Holding onto hope for life now
But I become consumed with doubt
Carrying the burdens of the world upon my shoulders
Looking for the answers, maybe I'll know once I'm older
But please hang on
Please hang with me
I'll be back soon
I'll be back time for me to go
I need some room to grow
I feel so alone
No one even knows
I just wanna disappear
Take me far away from here
I don't wanna face my fears
I just wanna disappear
I wanna do my best, but
I don't know what's next yet
I just need a reset
I just wanna be something
I just wanna change your life
I just wanna do it right
Everything I wanna do
Everything I wanna be
I see it all happen for me
I find it hard to believe
Finding it harder to breathe
Yeah
I just wanna feel complete
Why do I not feel complete?
Oh, I know that is on me
You all gave me everything
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Carrying the burdens of the world upon my shoulders
Looking for the answers, maybe I'll know once I'm older
Need some time to recollect myself, please don't forget me
When I disappear next week, I hope you can forgive me
Time for me to go
I need some room to grow
I feel so alone
No one even knows
I just wanna disappear
Take me far away from here
I don't wanna face my fears
I just wanna disappear
I don't wanna disappear
I just wanna stay right here
Moving is my greatest fear
Maybe I should disappear
