Late night
Call you in the late night
Trade love for one night
Two pills and a red wine
Talk offline, no
I don't mind
The words that you don't say
No love when you hold me
No callin' the next day, it's one way, no
And now the Sun is up, I'm comin' down
Nobody nowhere, I'm nobody nowhere
We just blow it up, blow it out
Sex, money, feelings, die
Baby, don't you cry
Sex, money, feelings, die
Baby, don't you cry
Sex, money, feelings, die
Ladies on my right
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
Oh, I
Afraid of the sunlight
I don't care to be alright
Two lines, one time
Every night, every weekend, weeknight
Oh, my
Lights off when I wake up
Tears under my makeup
Your lips will stay shut
When we wake up, break up
I don't wanna think about, think about you
Drink up, drink up, I'm so fucked up, all I want is you
No, I don't wanna think about, think about you
Drink up, drink up, I'm so fucked up
Sex, money, feelings, die
Baby, don't you cry
Sex, money, feelings, die
Baby, don't you cry
Sex, money, feelings, die
Ladies on my right
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
All night, all night, all night
All of these nights, sex, money, lies
All night, all night, all night, oh
All night, all night, all night
All of these nights, sex, money, lies
Sex, money, feelings, die
Baby, don't you cry
Sex, money, feelings, die
Baby, don't you cry
Sex, money, feelings, die
Ladies on my right
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
Baby, don't you cry
Sex, money, feelings, die
Baby, don't you cry
Sex, money, feelings, die
Ladies on my right
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
Sex, money, feelings, die
