I fall asleep in my own tears
I cry for the world, for everyone
And I build a boat to float in
I'm floating away
I can't recall last time I opened my eyes to see the world as beautiful
And I built a cage to hide in
I'm hiding, I'm trying to battle the night
Let love conquer your mind
Warrior, warrior
Just reach out for the light
Warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior
Warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior
Warrior, warrior of love
I stand behind the wall of people and thoughts, mind controling
And I hold a sword to guide me
I'm fighting my way
I can't recall last time I opened my eyes to see the world as beautiful
And I built a cage to hide in
I'm hiding, I'm trying to battle the night
Let love conquer your mind
Warrior, warrior
Just reach out for the light
Warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior
Warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior
Warrior, warrior of love
Underneath darkened skies
There's a light kept alight
Let love conquer your mind
Warrior, warrior
Just reach out for the light
Warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior
Warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior
Warrior, warrior of love
Warrior of love
Warrior of love
