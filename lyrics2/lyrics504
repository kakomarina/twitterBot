(Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart)
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh baby, won't you come again?
She said: I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought you were straight, now I'm wondering
You're so conceited, I said: I love you
What does it matter if I'm lying to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you do
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, socratic junkie wannabe
There's so much skin to see
A simple epicurean philosophy
Oh, and you say I'm such a clich√©
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself
You're so conceited, I said: I love you
What does it matter if I'm lying to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
