I know it hurts that we don't touch anymore
It's even worse because we built this from the floor
It's just as hard for me to know I might see you 'round
It's just as hard for me to worry 'bout reachin' out
The more I think about you, the more I keep the ghost alive
Yeah, the more I think about you, the more I keep the ghost alive
I want you bad, but it's done
I'm bleeding out, 'cause we can't go on
I want you bad, 'til I shake
I want what we had, but what's broken don't unbreak
Just when I'm ready to get over you, you call me up
And then I crumble when you say you're getting over us
But the more I think about you, the more I keep the ghost alive
Yeah, the more that I'm without you, the less I know if I was right
I want you bad, but it's done
I'm bleeding out, 'cause we can't go on
I want you bad, 'til I shake
I want what we had, but what's broken don't unbreak
And I won't tell you what I want to
What I want to
I'm falling through, I can't hide it
But I learn to
I want you bad, but it's done
I'm bleeding out, 'cause we can't go on
I want you bad, 'til I shake
I want what we had, but what's broken don't unbreak
I want you bad, but it's done
I want you bad, but we can't go on
