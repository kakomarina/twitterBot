This will never end, 'cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more
This will never end, 'cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more
If I had a heart, I could love you
If I had a voice, I would sing
After the night, when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
If I had a voice, I would sing
Dangling feet from window frame
Will they ever, ever reach the floor
More, give me more, give me more
Crushed and filled with all I found
Underneath and inside just to come around
More, give me more, give me more
