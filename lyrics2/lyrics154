My house in Budapest, my
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo
You, ooh, you
Ooh, I’d leave it all
My acres of a land
I have achieved
It may be hard for you to
Stop and believe
But for you, ooh, you
Ooh, I’d leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you
Ooh, I'd leave it all
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
My many artifacts
The list goes on
If you just say the words, I
I’ll up and run
Ooh, to you, ooh, you
Ooh, I’d leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh
Ooh, I'd leave it all
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
My friends and family
They don’t understand
They fear they’d lose so much if
If you take my hand
But, for you, ooh, you
Ooh, I’d lose it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you
Ooh, I'd lose it all
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me
Then all of this will go away
My house in Budapest, my
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo
You, ooh, you
Ooh, I’d leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you
Ooh, I'd leave it all
