Rise above, gonna start the war!
What you want, what you need, what'd you come here for?
Well, an eye for an eye and an F for fight
They're taking me down as the prisoners riot
Got the shackles on, my words are tied
Fear can make you compromise
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
Sometimes I wanna disappear
When I feel kinda bad and don't want to stress
I just pass it off on ability
Well, you got what you want, and what you never knew
Perfect gift from me to you
Got the shackles on, my words are tied
Fear can make you compromise
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
Sometimes I wanna disappear
(Raise up to your ability)
You never knew what I could find
What could come when they realize
I don't want to do the compromise
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah, I'm scared but I'll disappear
Running on my own before I count those years
Like I'm someone who lost their way
(Raise up to your ability)
I know that you want me
'Cause it's simple to see of my ability
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah, you're undecided
Yeah, so I can see that
Yeah, I don't wanna run away
You gotta focus on your ability
Focus on your ability
Gotta focus on your ability
Focus on your ability
Then they cannot get what they want to steal
Cannot get what they want to steal
Then they cannot get what they want to steal
Cannot get what they want to steal
