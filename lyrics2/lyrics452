Holy water cannot help you now
A thousand armies couldn't keep me out
I don't want your money
I don't want your crown
See, I've come to burn your kingdom down
Holy water cannot help you now
See, I've come to burn your kingdom down
And no rivers and no lakes can put the fire out
I'm going to raise the stakes
I'm going to smoke you out
Seven devils all around me
Seven devils in my house
See, they were there when I woke up this morning
And I'll be dead before the day is done
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See, I was dead when I woke up this morning
And I'll be dead before the day is done
Before the day is done
And now all your lies will be exorcised
And we will find your saints to be canonized
And it's an even song
It's a melody
It's a battle cry
It's a symphony
Seven devils all around me
Seven devils in my house
See, they were there when I woke up this morning
And I'll be dead before the day is done
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See, I was dead when I woke up this morning
And I'll be dead before the day is done
Before the day is done
Before the day is done
Before the day is done
You can keep me out
'Til I tear the walls
To devastate your heart
And to take your soul
For what has been done
Cannot be undone
In the eagle's eye
In the evensong
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See I was dead when I woke up this morning
And I'll be dead before the day is done
Before the day is done
