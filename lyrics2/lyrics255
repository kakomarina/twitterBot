I’m really on the ropes this time
I’ve been fighting all my life for you
I never should’ve said goodbye
Maybe that’s what stupid people do
Cuz you gave me peace and I wasted it
I’m here to admit that you were my medicine
Oh I couldn’t quit and I’m down on my knees again
Asking for nothing
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Don’t think I could forgive myself
I’m sorry for the ways that I used you
And I could care less right now
But you know you hurt me pretty good too
Yeah, we made each other bleed and we tasted it
I’m here to admit
That you were my medicine
Oh love I couldn’t quit
And I’m down on my knees again
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
So wake me up when they build that time machine
I want to go back
Wake me up when you were sleeping next to me
Cuz I really loved you
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Yeah
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
