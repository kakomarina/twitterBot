I'm glued to the thoughts in my mind
They pester, they go walk in the sky
I am glued to the love in you
It swallows me, hold your heart till it goo
Oh, that's not what I wanna do
Perfectly attached like a noodle in the soup
You're glued with the XYZ, I'm glued with the ABC
And DEFG, HIJK, baby
We all have a strong suit spelled differently
Different experience, different needs
I know we can't die at the same time thеy're playing
I don't wanna think about the morbid parts of life no morе
I'm trying just to look in some, the things that hold me something
For some sticky, sticky stuck, it's all, all tied to this reality
I'm seeing of what I wish, to be achieving the old idea of me is
Glued up, sometimes it's too much
I'm fucked up and clueless
Stuck in the vortex, stuck in the vortex
Clueless, life would be boring
Empty but no hurting
'Cause it's necessary to touch when it's scary
When my petty feet start to sway
You better turn around the other way
When the doubt starts creeping in
It's hard to let go of all this control
Patterns that I picked up from the end, baby
Cut our negatives of talkin', cut out my procrastination
Being sticky, stuck, glue all those habits shut
Pace me to a new way of being something and breathe new life in me again
Glued up, sometimes it's too much
I'm fucked up and clueless
Stuck in the vortex, stuck in the vortex
Clueless, life would be boring
Empty but no hurting
'Cause it's necessary to touch when it's scary
Glued up, sometimes it's too much
I'm fucked up and clueless
Clueless
Clueless, life would be boring
Empty but no hurting
Hurting oh, oh
Glued up, sometimes it's too much
I'm fucked up and clueless
Clueless, life would be boring
Empty but no hurting
'Cause it's necessary to touch when it's scary
