Broken mornings, broken nights
And broken days in between
Open ground, the sky is open
Makes an open scene
Just like in fiction, in every addiction
Oh fantasy's taking over, awake me
I've been looking for the conqueror
But you don't seem to come my way
I've been looking for the only one
But you don't seem to come my way
Broken me and broken them
And you are broken too
Open ears, their eyes are open
Makes me call for you
But there's no seduction, only destruction
Oh, fantasy take me over and break me
I've been looking for the conqueror
But you don't seem to come my way
I've been looking for the only one
But you don't seem to come my way
I've been looking for the conqueror
But you don't seem to come my way
I've been looking for the only one
But you don't seem to come my way
But I feel a-li-li-live
I feel a-li-li-live
I feel a-li-li-live
I feel a-li-li-live
I've been looking for the conqueror
But you don't seem to come my way
I've been looking for the only one
But you don't seem to come my way
I've been looking for the conqueror
But you don't seem to come my way
I've been looking for the only one
But you don't seem to come my way
I feel a-li-li-live (ah, ah ya, ah, ah ya)
I feel a-li-li-live (ah, ah ya, ah, ah ya)
I feel a-li-li-live (ah, ah ya, ah, ah ya)
I feel a-li-li-live
