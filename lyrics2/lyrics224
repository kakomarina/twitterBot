Where have you been hiding?
You seem lost within your body and your mind
A beam of light can still remind you who you are
Wounded by the world
Your fragile nature needed shelter
In the night we made a sanctum
Out of mind and out of sight
Won't you let me take you there?
Won't you let me take you there?
Let me take you into the garden, into the garden
I'll be there, painting the flowers, give them color
I'll be there
Listen to the anthem
Hear the flowers like their hymn has healing power
Take my hand and breathe in, the colorful
Won't you let me take you there?
Won't you let me take you there?
Let me take you into the garden, into the garden
I'll be there, painting the flowers, give them color
I'll be there
Let me take you into the garden, into the garden
I'll be there, painting the flowers, give them color
I'll be there
Try to heal the heart of mine
In the garden we find
Try to heal the heart of mine
In the garden we find
Inside, inside
