Take your time, I'll be right here
I know no one could ever love me better
Take all night, you're the truth that is breaking me
And keeping me together, together
I wanna be your touch
Sleeping's so tough, you're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on, chew on my heart
Come on, chew on my heart
I wanna be your touch
Sleeping's so tough, you're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on, chew on my heart
Come on, chew on my heart
I'm a fire, I'm a hot mess
I'm thinking things that I might start regretting
So hear me out, I need you now
I'm spiralling, I'm sinking down
Wait for me, I'm sending up a message
A message
I wanna be your touch
Sleeping's so tough, you're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on, chew on my heart
Come on, chew on my heart
I wanna be your touch
Sleeping's so tough, you're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on, chew on my heart
Come on, chew on my heart
(Ooh, ooh)
Tear me apart
(Ooh, ooh)
Tear me apart
I wanna be your touch
Sleeping's so tough, it's burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on, chew on my heart
Come on, chew on my heart
I wanna be your touch
Sleeping's so tough, you're burning up my mind
What would it feel like if you tore me apart?
Come on, chew on my heart
Come on, chew on my heart
(Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh)
