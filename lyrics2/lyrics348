Life's too short to even care at all oh
I'm losing my mind losing my mind losing control
These fishes in the sea they're staring at me oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum
Oh
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away
To some fortune that I should have found by now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down, come down
Life's too short to even care at all oh
I'm coming up now coming up now out of the blue
These zombies in the park they're looking for my heart
Oh oh oh oh
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun oh oh
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away
To some fortune that I should have found by now
And so I run out to the things they say could, restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down
Life's too short to even care at all oh
I'm losing my mind losing my mind losing control
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away
To some fortune that I should have found by now
So I run out to the things they said could, restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down
One more spoon of cough syrup now, oh
One more spoon of cough syrup now, oh
