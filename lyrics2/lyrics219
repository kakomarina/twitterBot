See the money wanna stay, for your meal
Get another piece of pie, for your wife
Everybody wanna know, how it feel
Everybody wanna see, what it's like
Baby wanna be a queen, well alright
We all deserve the finer things, in this life
So working on a little job, in the night
It's forty dollars an hour when I, see the light
The boss say you got a little time, and oh my
He'll be working in a small box, till he die
Me, I gotta be free, all my life
I want a little cream cheese, in my pie
Alright
Yeah! I'll step back, while you go dance
The greenback boogie
Mother f*ing boogie
Now I'm putting on a big wig, walking hard
Hanging with them big pigs, all them dogs
Got me a couple ideas, straight from God
I want a bean pie order me a bean pie
I'll even eat a bean pie, I don't mind
Me and missy is so very busy busy making money
Alright...
All step back, I'm 'bout to dance
The greenback boogie
The greenback boogie
Boogie now for me
Say, it's far better, when you give it away
It's called the greenback boogie
What people don't say, I say
It's better, when you give it away
It's called the greenback boogie
Don't give it away now, I say
It's better, when you give it away
It's called the greenback boogie
Don't give it away now, I say
See the money wanna stay, for your meal
I'll say it's gonna put some love, in your life
Don't you really wanna know, how it feel?
Everybody wanna see, what it's like
Babe you wanna be inside, it ain't lies
We all know there's better things in this life
Yes, I'll step out, on your expense
Doin' the greenback boogie
Mother f*ing boogie
Boogie oogie oogie
Greenback boogie
Come on back to paradise
Come on back to paradise
Come on back to paradise
Come on back to
Come on back to
Come on back to paradise
Come on back to paradise
Come on back to paradise
Come on back to
Come on back to
It's the greenback boogie
It's the greenback boogie
Don't give it away now
Don't give it away now, I say
It's better, when you greenback boogie
Well don't give it away
Well don't give it away, I say
It's better
It's the greenback boogie
Don't give it away
