Stand beside it, we can't hide the way it makes us glow
It's no good unless it grows, feel this burning love of mine
Deep inside the ever-spinning, tell me does it feel
It's no good unless it's real, hill sides burning
Wild-eyed turning till we're running from it
I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two
You say swimming in the lake we'll come across a snake
It is real and then it's fake, feel it's heartbeat
Feel what you heat, far so fast it feels too late
I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
