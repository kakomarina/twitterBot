Spend some time away
Getting ready for the day
You're born again
Spend some time alone
Understand that soon
You'll run with better men
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone
No use looking out
It's within that brings
That lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You'll be clear
Among the better men
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone
