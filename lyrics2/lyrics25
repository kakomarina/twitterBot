Ha, ha!
Wooh!
Hey God, I'll be the jester
Entertain ya to the best of my ability
When I suffer more, fragility, when I answer
Pay me for a reason, oh-oh
So stop complaining, I'll have our seasons, oh-oh
It's not just a joke or a lesson to live through
Every which way and second there's a breakthrough
I'm mortal, oh-oh-oh
Defected by this form, oh-oh-oh
So I'd rather be tested by goddesses
Resting their heads upon pillows
Of all they have learned
I'm not to be forgottеn
Trap your books when I walk in
Magic talks, without talking
I'll make the most bеfore the coffin
Born to be desired, oh-oh
Gotta learn, yeah, eyes are always on the next score
But space isn't there to always be filled up
It's the quiet, the downtime to breathe in my lungs
'Cause I'm mortal, oh-oh-oh
Defected by this form, oh-oh-oh
So I beg to be tested by goddesses
Resting their heads upon pillows
Of all they have learned
'Cause I'm mortal
Test me, I'm mortal
And I beg to be tested by goddesses
Resting their heads upon pillows of all they have learned
'Cause I'm mortal, oh-oh-oh, defected by this form, oh-oh-oh
And I beg to be tested by goddesses
Resting their heads upon pillows of all they have learned
'Cause I'm mortal, oh-oh-oh
(Give me an A+ if I'm doing this thing right)
Oh-oh-oh, defected by this form, oh-oh-oh
And I'd rather be be tested by goddesses
Resting their heads upon pillows of all they have learned
