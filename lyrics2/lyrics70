I wonder if they see
That you don't belong to me
Wish that you could be mine, mine
Wish that you could be
I've been gettin'
Lost in translation
Trouble keepin' up
Communication
We were havin' fun
Now I can't wait to be done
It feels like I'm the only one
That's sick of playin'
Baby (baby)
Why you gotta keep me hangin'?
It's like an apple of temptation, yeah
You let me get a bite
Out of sight, out of mind
Until I found a bruise
On the other side
Time (time)
Ooh, do it to me one more
I've been gettin'
Lost in translation
Trouble keepin' up
Communication
We were havin' fun
Now I can't wait to be done
It feels like I'm the only one
That's sick of playin'
Sick (ooh, I'm)
Tired of people tellin' me
Be patient, yeah
Tryin' to light the fire
With no flame (No flame)
Tryna figure out
What you're sayin' to me
I wish I didn't need you to explain (ooh)
Time (time)
Oh, do it to me one more
Time (time)

Time, do it to me one more
I've been gettin'

We were havin' fun
Now I can't wait to be done
It feels like I'm the only one

Oh no, no, no
Do it to me, do it to me
Do it to me one more time
(One more time, oh, oh)
Do it to me, do it to me
Do it to me one more time
