Youâ€™ve been my muse for a long time
You get me through every dark night
I'm always gone, out on the go
I'm on the run and you're home alone
I'm too consumed with my own life
Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move
Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down
I've been confused as of late (yeah)
Watching my youth slip away (yeah)
You're like the sun, you make me young
But you drain me out if I get too much
I might need you on my break
Are we too young for this?
Feels like I can't move
Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down
I don't want to play this part
But I do, I feel young
I don't want to make this hard but now I will
'Cause I'm stuck
Sharing my heart
It's tearing me apart
But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
Doing what I can, tryna be a man (be your man)
And every time I kiss you, baby
I can hear the sound of breaking down
Sharing my head, mhm
Sharing my head, yeah
Sharing my head
Sharing my head
(Breaking down)
Sharing my heart
It's tearing me and suddenly I'm
(Breaking down)
It's tearing my mind
It's tearing my life
