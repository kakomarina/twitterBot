She may contain
The urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Cetirizine your fever's gripped me again
Never kisses
All you ever send are full-stops
Do you know
Where the wilds things go
They go along to take your honey
Break down now weep build up breakfast now let's eat
My love, my love, love, love
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
Do you know
Where the wild things go
They go along to take your honey
Break down lets sleep
Build up breakfast now let's eat
My love, my love, love, love
She bruises coughs
She splutters pistol shots
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
She's morphine
Queen of my vaccine
My love, my love, love, love
Muscle to muscle
And toe to toe
The fear has gripped me
But here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
She may contain
The urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Germolene disinfect the scene
My love, my love, love, love
But please don't go
I love you so
My lovely
Please don't go
Please don't go
I love you so
I love you so
Please don't go
Please don't go
I love you so
I love you so (please break my heart)
Please don't go
Please don't go
I love you so
I love you so
Please don't go
Please don't go
I love you so
I love you so (please break my heart)
Please don't go
I need you whole
I love you so
I love you so, I love you so
