Pack yourself a toothbrush dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip
Take all of your savings out
'Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out
I was not born to drown, baby come on
Forget what Father Brennan said
We were not born in sin
Leave a note on your bed
Let your mother know you're safe
And by the time she wakes
We'll have driven through the state
We'll have driven through the night, baby come on
If the sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you lay yourself down and dig your grave?
Or will you rail against your dying day?
And when we looked outside
Couldn't even see the sky
How do you pay the rent?
Is it your parents
Or is hard work, dear?
Holding the atmosphere
I don't wanna live like that, yeah
If the sun don't shine on me today
If the subways flood and the bridges break
Jesus Christ can't save me tonight
Put on your dress, yes, wear something nice
Decide on me, yea, decide on us
Oh, oh, oh, Illinois, Illinois
Pack yourself a toothbrush, dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip
Take all of your savings out
'Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out
