What day is it
And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up, and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people
With nothing to do, nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people and
I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you
All of the things that I want to say
Just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words, you've got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people
With nothing to do, nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people and
I don't why I can't keep my eyes off of you
Something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people
With nothing to do, nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people and
I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you
You and me and all of the people
With nothing to do, nothing to prove and
It's you and me and all of the people and
I don't why I can't keep my eyes off of you
What day is it
And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
