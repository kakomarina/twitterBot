Hey, where's the drums?
Woo oh
Let's go!
Woo, girl, you're shining
Like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style
Woo, pretty baby
This world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me
When I just wanna make you smile
I wanna thrill you like Michael
I want to kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this
You' re over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah; gone plastic)
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah)
Baby, you
Baby, you're so classic
Four dozen roses
Anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you
Doing in Sinatra style
I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac
Like a gentleman, bringin' glamour back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle
I wanna thrill you like Michael
I want to kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this
You' re over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's like a rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it, like it
Out of my league, old school chic
Like a moviestar from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah)
Baby, you're so classic (so classic; yeah, yeah)
Baby, you're so classic
Baby you're classy, and, baby, you're sick
I never met a girl like you ever 'til we met
A star in the 40s, centerfold in the 50s'
Got met trippin' out like the 60s, hippies
Queen of the discotheque
A 70s dream and a 80s best
Hepburn, Beyonc√©, Marilyn, Massey
Girl, you're timeless
Just so classic!
You' re over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's like a rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it, like it
Out of my league, old school chic
Like a moviestar from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (whoa, oh)
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah)
Baby, you're so classic
Ooh
