I was on the outside looking in
Now I'm on the inside trying to stay
Out of my head
I need peace of mind
Grew up pretty fast
Good things never last
You gotta live before you learn
Now I'm somewhere far
Away from where I started
With no point of return
But I'm turning
I was on the outside looking in
Now I'm on the inside trying to stay
Out of my head
I need peace of mind
Landed in the middle of somewhere
With you
Now you're stranded in the middle of somewhere
Too
Always running away
Looking for an escape
Everyone is an alien
When you're trying to find your place
Trying to stay out
Trying to stay out of my head
Trying to stay out
