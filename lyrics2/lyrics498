Let it never be said
That romance is dead
'Cause there's so little else
Occupying my head
There is nothing I need
Except the function to breathe
But I'm not really fussed
Doesn't matter to me
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing to me?
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Due to lack of interest
Tomorrow is cancelled
Let the clocks be reset
And the pendulums held
'Cause there's nothing at all
Except the space in between
Finding out what you're called
And repeating your name
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing to me?
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Could it be, could it be
That you're joking with me
And you don't really see
You and me?
Could it be, could it be
That you're joking with me
And you don't really see
You with me?
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing to me?
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Know what you're doing, doing to me?
