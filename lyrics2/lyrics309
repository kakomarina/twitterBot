Something about you
It's like an addiction
Hit me with your best shot, honey
I've got no reason to doubt you
'Cause certain things hurt
And you're my only virtue
And I'm virtually yours
And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running round, running round
Running round my head
And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
There's something about you
It's when you get angry
You have me at your mercy, oh
And you're like a shoulder to turn to
'Cause certain things mend us
When we're hanging on for dear life
We held on so tight
And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running round, running round
Running round my head
And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
(Let's ignore them, let's ignore them)
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
I adore you, I adore you
Certain that I'm yours
(Let's ignore them, let's ignore them)
I adore you, I adore you
Oh, I adore you, I adore you
Let's ignore them, let's ignore them
Let's ignore them, let's ignore them
Let's ignore them, let's ignore them
Certain that I'm yours
