What time you coming out?
We started losing light
I'll never make it right
If you don't want me around
I'm so excited for the night
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said some day we might
When I'm closer to your height
'Til then we'll knock around, endlessly
You're all I need
Don't you see me now?
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
Don't you need me?
I, I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And on this night and in this light
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
Maybe you'll change your mind
I think I'm falling, I think I'm falling
I'm caught on your coat again
You said: Oh, no, it's fine
I read between the lines
And touched your leg again, again
I'll take you one day at a time
Soon you will be mine
Oh but I want you now (I want you now)
When the smoke is in your eyes
You look so alive
Do you fancy sitting down with me? Maybe?
You're all I need
According to your heart
My place is not deliberate
Feeling of your arms
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your neck
Don't you see me?
I, I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
Don't you need me?
I, I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And on this night and in this light
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
Maybe you'll change your mind
