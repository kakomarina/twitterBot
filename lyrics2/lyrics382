Drifting through the halls with the sunrise
(Holding on for your call)
Climbing up the walls for that flashing light
(I can never let go)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Maybe not tonight)
Now the Sun is up and I'm going blind
(Holding on for your call)
Another drink just to pass the time
(I can never say no)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Maybe not tonight)
It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Till Delilah showed me how
Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around
Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of danger in the daylight
(I can never let go)
Took anything to cut you, I can find
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of a danger in the daylight
(Can't you let me know?)
Now it's one more boy and it's one more lie
(Holding on for your call)
Taking the pills just to pass the time
(I can never say no)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Holding on for your call)
Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
(Maybe not tonight)
It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Till Delilah showed me how
Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of danger in the daylight
(I can never let go)
Took anything to cut you, I can find
(Holding on for your call)
A different kind of a danger in the daylight
(Can't you let me know?)
Strung up, strung out for your love
Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
I'm wrung and ringing out
Why can't you let me know?
Strung up, strung out for your love
Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
I'm wrung and ringing out
Why can't you let me know?
It's a different kind of danger
And the bells are ringing out

As I pull the pillars down
It's a different kind of danger

Never knew I was a dancer
'Till Delilah showed me how
It's a different kind of danger

Too fast for freedom
Sometimes it all falls down
These chains never leave me
I keep dragging them around
