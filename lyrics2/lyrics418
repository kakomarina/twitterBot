Could it be I was the one
That you held so deep in the night?
On the back staircase
You fell to your knees with tears in your eyes
All that you suffered, all the disease
You couldn't hide it, hide it from me
All alone, scared in your room
Would you swear there's nobody home?
On the bed, laying awake
As you prayed he'd leave you alone
I'll let the darkness swallow me whole
I need to find you, need you to know
I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
Like the salt and the sea
And they wrote all these prescriptions
They wrote me off like a heel
Yeah, the doctors with their medicine
Left me to rock in my filth
From the destruction, out of the flame
You need a villain, give me a name
I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
Like the salt and the sea
Like the salt and the sea
