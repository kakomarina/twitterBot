Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one
He holds the gun against my head
I close my eyes and bang, I am dead
I know he knows that he’s killing me for mercy
And here I go
And here I go
He holds my body in his arms
He didn't mean to do no harm
And he holds me tight
He did it all to spare me from the awful things in life that comes
And he cries and cries
I know he knows that he’s killing me for mercy
And here I go
And here I go
He holds my body in his arms
He didn't mean to do no harm
And he holds me tight
He did it all to spare me from the awful things in life that comes
And he cries and cries
Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one
The gun is gone
And so am I
And here I go
