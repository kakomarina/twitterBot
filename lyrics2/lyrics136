Took the breath from my open mouth
Never known how it broke me down
I went in circles somewhere else
Shook the best when your love was home
Store up on your summer glow
You went in search of someone else
And I hear the ship is comin' in
Your tears a sea for me to swim
And I hear a storm is comin' in
My dear is it all we've ever been?
Caught the air in your woven mouth
Leave it all I'll be hearing how you went
In search of someone else
Taught the hand that taught the bride
Both our eyes lock to the tide
We went in circles somewhere else
And I hear the ship is comin' in
Your tears a sea for me to swim
And I hear a storm is comin' in
My dear is it all we've ever been?
Anchor up to me, love
Anchor up to me, love
Anchor up to me, love
Oh, anchor up to me, my love
