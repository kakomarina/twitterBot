Temporary people
Temporary feelings
Everything's so pointless
Say a bunch of stuff
Make me fall in love
Then we'll give it up
There's no reason to live
There's no reason to live
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I'm sad
I'm so sad
Hey girl you're cutie
Wait, no that's a watermelon
It's been so long time since I had any affection from a woman
I'm so lonely
I don't have a reason to live
I'm searching for a reason to live
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I'm sad
I'm so sad
I've been holed up way too long yeah
I've been trying to forget her
How can she just go so easy?
Now I'm giving up completely
I've been trying way too hard yeah
I've been needing to move on and
How can she just come so briefly?
Always falling hard so deeply
You can go
You can go
You can go
You can go
You wanna know what's sad?
You can give everything you have to a person
And you can be perfect for that person
You can be everything they've ever wanted and you can do everything perfectly
And it still wouldn't be enough
Because nothing's ever enough and everyone sucks
