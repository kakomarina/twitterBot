I've never fit into any category, always deemed an outcast
Since I was in Sunday school and all the cool kids said I was weird
It's exactly the same, they say
Why do you dress that way? Why do you act that way?
Why don't you dress like me?
So is that what you really wanna say to me?
You playin' games with me
Tellin' you're for my kind, still you abandon me
Calling me words I'm not paintin' a picture that's false
You must not know my heart, but I know it isn't your fault
You live in a world and you clutch, you don't get out very much
Livin' in the fake world, full of facades and chaotic behavior
You pull the lever for fun, yell fire, then you just run
Fire drill, what would happen if a nuke just hit
Would you say bye to your family? Would you post about it?
Fire drill, if it all went up in flames one day
Would you give your mom a hug before your house burned away?
It kills, I wish the best for you
And you think I ignore you too, but
Really, I'm tryna live my own life
Be present more, and so should you, it's alright to
Cryin' inside
'Cause nothin' I ever say comes alright
We're on the same side
If I'm honest with you, you just run and hide
I'm bad at public speaking
But I'm speaking now so hear me out (shut up)
I personally believe that everyone is fully capable
Of more than what they're doing, all of the bullying
All of the screwing around with people they don't even really know, oh
Eatin' a hate souffl√©, and an angry bit of sorbet
All 'cause you were bored one day
Losing your wits and your grace
Fire drill, what would happen if a nuke just hit
Would you stay bye to your family? Would you post about it?
Fire drill, if it all went up in flames one day
Would you give your mom a hug before your house burned away?
It kills, I wish the best for you
And you think I ignore you too, but
Really, I'm tryna live my own life
Be present more, and so should you, it's alright to
I'm not the government
I'm not the fucked up men
I'm not a part of anything that is hateful
Love is seeping out my pores, I don't hold anger anymore
Even for people who hurt and betrayed me (okay)
I'm not the government
I'm not the fucked up men (gross)
I'm not a part of anything that is hateful
Love is seeping out my pores, I don't hold anger anymore
Even for people who hurt and betrayed me

I'm getting out of here
