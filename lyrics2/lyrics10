Oh hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape it
I don't want to fake it
I wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe
But I'm a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
I'm a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
You're free to go
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been asking
Oh, I’ve been asking for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I’ve been asking (trust me, darlin')
Oh, I've been asking for problems, problems, problems (trust me, darlin')
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape it
I don’t want to fake it
I wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe
But I'm a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
I'm a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
You're free to go
I can't breathe
I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me this one time, believe me
I'm a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
Now you know
I'm a bad liar
Bad liar
Now you know
You're free to go
Please believe me
Please believe me
