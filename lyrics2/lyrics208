Rule number one is that you gotta have fun
But baby when you're done
You gotta be the first to run
Rule number two: Just don't get attached to
Somebody you could lose
So le-let me tell you
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing lo-lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing lo-lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh
Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you
Rule number three: Wear your heart on your cheek
But never on your sleeve
Unless you wanna taste defeat
Rule number four: Gotta be looking pure
Kissing goodbye at the door
And leave him wanting more, more
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing lo-lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing lo-lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh
Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you
Girls, we do, whatever it will take
Cause girls don't want, we don't want our hearts to break, in two
So it's better to be fake, can't risk losing
In love again, baby
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing lo-lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing lo-lo-lo-love you
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh
Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do
