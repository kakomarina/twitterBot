Larry call a load of smoke in
I wanna lose a couple days
We've probably never struggled coping
But I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time cause I'm 7 hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call though (but I always want to)
And I'd beg you, but you know I'm never home
And I'd love you, but I need another year alone
And I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close
And I don't think through things, I never get time
Cause I don't think things through
