It's a long night and a big crowd
Under these lights looking 'round for you
Yeah, I'm steppin' outside under moonlight
To get my head right, lookin' out for you, yeah
Could it be your eyes?
Didn't know that I've been
Waiting, waiting for you
When you're by my side
Everything's alright
Crazy, I'm crazy for you
Oh, here I go, down that road
Again and again the fool rushin' in
But I can't help when I feel some kind of way
Do you feel the same?
'Cause I fall, I fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
And I'll fall for you
Nah, it's a long night and a big crowd
Under these lights looking 'round for you
You, you give me hope, rhyme
Reason desire living this life
Only now for you
Oh, for you
When you by my side everything's alright
I'm crazy, I'm crazy for you
Oh, here I go down that road
Again and again the fool rushin' in
But I can't help when I feel so kind of way
Do you feel the same?
'Cause I fall, I fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
I fall, I fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
I'll fall for you
And now you've gone and got, a hold of me
Tell me what you're gonna do to me?
And now you've gone and got you're hands on me
Ohh, tell me what you're gonna do?
Here I go down that road
Again and again the fool rushin' in
But I can't help when I feel so kind of way
Do you feel the same?
'Cause I fall, I fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
Yeah, I fall, I fall for you
You caught me at my weakest
And I fall for you
