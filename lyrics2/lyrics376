Indochina, Capa jumps jeep
Two feet creep up the road
To photo, to record
Meat lumps and war
They advance as does his chance
Oooh, oooh
Very yellow white flash
A violent wrench grips mass
Rips light, tears limbs like rags
Burst so high finally capa lands
Mine is a watery pit
Painless with immense distance
From medic, from colleague, friend
Enemy, foe, him five yards from his leg
From you Taro
Oooh, oooh
Do not spray into eyes
I have sprayed you into my eyes
3:10 Pm, Capa pends death
Quivers, last rattles, last chokes
All colours and cares glaze to grey
Shrivelled and stricken to dots
Left hand grasps
What the body grasps not
Ooh, oooh
Le photographe est mort
3.1415, Alive no longer my amour
Faded for home may of '54
Doors open like arms my love
Painless with a great closeness
To capa, to capa capa dark after nothing
Re-united with his leg and with you, Taro
Taro
Do not spray into eyes
I have sprayed you into my eyes
