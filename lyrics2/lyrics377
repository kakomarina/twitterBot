I've been beaten and broken and tread upon
I was made to feel stupid when I was young
And they so no is the answer to the temptations
When those demons come rushing, nowhere to run
Sometimes I feel nothing at all
Sometimes I want someone to hold
Sometimes I carry on
Just to stumble down once more
Sometimes I, I, I wanna fall
I teach love is the fluid in all my songs
But then I faked my way through it with alcohol
I speak the language so fluid
Lost in translation
But I guess they don't see you in their camera phones
Sometimes I feel nothing at all
Sometimes I want someone to hold
Sometimes I carry on
Just to stumble down once more
Sometimes I, I, I wanna fall
Yeah, yeah, oh, I just wanna fall down
Yeah, oh, I just wanna fall
I just wanna fall
I just wanna fall
Sometimes I carry on
I just stumble down once more
Sometimes I, I, I wanna fall
