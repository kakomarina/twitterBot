You pull me by my hair, so I don't go nowhere
Tell me you love me, but you treat me like I'm never there
You say the cruelest words, you use to they break my heart
'Cause I'm over here working my ass off
Why is it so hard to see? (Why?)
If I cut myself, I would bleed (kill me)
I'm just like you, you're like me (uhum)
Imperfect and human, are we?
Show and tell
I'm on display for all you fuckers to see
Show and tell
Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me
Buy and sell (buy and sell me, baby)
Like I'm a product to society
Art don't sell
Unless you fucked every authority
You beg and cry for more, and yet I'm on the floor
There are strangers takin' pictures of me when I ask no more
It's really hard for me to say just how I feel
I'm scared that I'll get thrown away like a banana peel
Why is it so hard to see? (Why?)
If I cut myself, I would bleed (kill me)
I'm just like you, you're like me
Imperfect and human, are we?
Show and tell (show and tell)
I'm on display for all you fuckers to see (fuckers to see)
Show and tell (show and tell)
Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me
Buy and sell
Like I'm a product to society
Art don't sell
Unless you fucked every authority
Show and tell
Why can't you fucking hear me?
Show and tell, uh-hum
Are you listening yet?
Show and tell (show and tell, baby)
I'm on display for all you fuckers to see (fuckers to see)
Show and tell (oh)
Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me
Buy and sell
Like I'm a product to society
Art don't sell
Unless you fucked every authority
