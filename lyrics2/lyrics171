Don't cut me, punch me, just let me go
Into the nurse's office where I float away
I'm pale as the loose-leaf paper they grow
From hollowing out all my lungs in the snow
Yeah, I'm coughing, I'm bleeding
Band-Aids won't heal it
'Cause they hate me, so I'm fakin'
All, all, all this so they ta-take me
Take me home
Give me that pink slip of permission
This is old
I'm tired of wishing I was ditching
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Teacher, can I sit right there?
This bitch behind me is cutting my hair
No, just sit your ass down, at the chalkboard you stare
I faked up a seizure and left outta there
Yeah, I'm coughing, I'm bleeding
Band-Aids won't heal it
'Cause they hate me, so I'm fakin'
All, all, all this so they ta-take me
Take me home
Give me that pink slip of permission
This is old
I'm tired of wishing I was ditching
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Take me home
Give me that pink slip of permission
This is old
I'm tired of wishing I was ditching
Home
It's old
