Got a secret, can you keep it? Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket taking this one to the grave
If I show you, then I know you won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Why do you smile like you've been told a secret?
Now you're tellin' lies 'cause you have sworn to keep it
But no one keeps a secret, no one keeps a secret
Why when do our darkest deeds do we tell?
They burn in our brains, become a living hell
'Cause everybody tells, everybody tells
Got a secret, can you keep it? Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket taking this one to the grave
If I show you, then I know you won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Look into my eyes
Now you're getting sleepy
Are you hypnotized by secrets that you're keeping?
I know what you're keeping
I know what you're keeping
Got a secret, can you keep it? Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket taking this one to the grave
If I show you, then I know you won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Allison?
Yes, Catherine?
I have something I want to tell you, but you have to promise never to tell anyone
I promise
Do you swear on your life?
I swear on my life
You swore you'd never tell
You swore you'd never tell
You swore you'd never tell
You swore you'd never tell
Got a secret, can you keep it? Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket taking this one to the grave
If I show you, then I know you won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Got a secret, can you keep it? Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket taking this one to the grave
If I show you, then I know you won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Got a secret, can you keep it? Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it in your pocket taking this one to the grave
If I show you, then I know you won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Yes, two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Yes, two can keep a secret if one of us is dead
