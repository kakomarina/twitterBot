Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's
Watching you
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
Just stay there
'Cause I'll be comin' over
And while our bloods still young
It's so young, It runs
And we won't stop til it's over
Won't stop to surrender
Songs
Of desperation
I played them for you
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
Just stay there
'Cause I'll be comin' over
And while our bloods still young
It's so young, It runs
And we won't stop til it's over
Won't stop to surrender
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs (won't stop til it's over)
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs (won't stop til it's over)
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs (won't stop til it's over)
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A moment, a love (Won't stop to surrender)
A moment, a love
