Stood at the cold face
Stood with our backs to the sun
I can remember being nothing but fearless and young
We’ve become echoes, but echoes, they fade away
We've fallen to the dark as we dive under the waves
(I heard you say)
Devil's on your shoulder
Strangers in your head
As if you don’t remember
As if you can forget
It’s only been a moment
It’s only been a lifetime
But tonight you’re a stranger
Some silhouette
Let's go out in flames
So everyone knows who we are
'Cause these city walls never knew
That we'd make it this far
We've become echoes
But echoes are fading away
So, let's dance like two shadows
Burning out a glory day
Devil's on your shoulder
Strangers in your head
As if you don’t remember
As if you can forget
It’s only been a moment
It’s only been a lifetime
But tonight you’re a stranger
Some silhouette
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me
Just hold me
Devil's on your shoulder
Strangers in your head
As if you don’t remember
As if you can forget
It’s only been a moment
It’s only been a lifetime
But tonight you’re a stranger
Some silhouette
It’s only been a moment
It’s only been a lifetime
But tonight you’re a stranger
Some silhouette
But tonight you’re a stranger
Some silhouette
