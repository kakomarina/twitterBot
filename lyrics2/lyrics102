Sometimes I'm beaten
Sometimes I'm broke
'Cause sometimes this city
Is nothing but smoke
Is there a secret?
Is there a code?
Can we make it better?
'Cause I'm losing hope
Tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
After the wreckage
After the dust
I still hear the howling
I still feel the rush
Over the riots
Above all the noise
And through all the worry
I still hear your voice
So tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes out
That even in the dark we will find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
We used to be kids living just for the kicks
In cinema seats learning how to kiss
Running through streets that were painted gold
We never believed we'd grow up like this
So tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes out
That even in the dark we will find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
I believe in something
I believe in us
