My family always said I was the bad child
Throwing me away into the bad pile
All my life been putting on a fake smile
Sitting on my own, feel like I'm exiled
Feeling like I always do the wrong things
Telling all their friends that I'm the bad kid
Now I'm on my own, I lost my magic
Dealing with your bullshit now I'm over it
And you took a part of me
Left me with the memories oh
We were never a family
Now you're standing in front of my door oh oh oh
Like none of this happened at all, all, all, all
I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child
I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child
'Cause you will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind
And to every single person here that doubts me
Telling me that they could live without me
'Cause they will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind
I've never really been the one to reach out
Acting like my life was squeaky clean now
Like everything I do is just a letdown
Feeling like I always do the wrong things
Telling all their friends that I'm the bad kid
Now I'm on my own, I lost my magic
Dealing with your bullshit now I'm over it
And you took a part of me
Left me with the memories, oh
We were never a family
Now you're standing in front of my door oh oh oh
Like none of this happened at all, all, all, all
I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child
I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child
'Cause you will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind
And to every single person here that doubts me
Telling me that they could live without me
'Cause they will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind
They say I've lost my mind
They say I'll never find it
I think they're kinda right
In fact I kinda like it
They say I've lost my mind
They say I'll never find it
I think they kinda right
I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child
I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child
'Cause you will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind
And to every single person here that doubts me
Telling me that they could live without me
'Cause they will never understand my weird mind
My weird mind
My family always said I was the bad child
