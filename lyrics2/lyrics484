Tied to a sallow heart
Why does he want to bring me where he goes?
Oh, and to find out the reasons why
It's enough to make you wanna try
For one last night
Ghosts and silhouettes
They take a piece of me they want it all
Oh, but to wait in an empty room
With the feeling that is closing in
I had a dream I was dying
But I found nobody there
And if one last night is all that we've been given
Lets live it like we care
For one last night
For one last night
Broken upon the rocks
Let the beating waves
Come drag me down
Oh, but to find out the reasons why
It's enough to make you wanna try
For one last night
I had a dream I was dying
But I found nobody there
And if one last night is all that we've been given
Lets live it like we care
For one last night
For one last night
For one last night
