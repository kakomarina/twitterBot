The underdogs are my lions
The silent ones are my choir
The women will be my soldiers
With the weight of life on their shoulders
Drink until you’ve had enough
I’ll drink from your hands
I will be your warrior
I will be your lamb
Till queendom come
Till queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come
The sea waves are my evening gown
And the Sun on my head is my crown
I made this queendom on my own
And all the mountains are my throne
Drink until you’ve had enough
I’ll drink from your hands
I will be your warrior
I will be your lamb
Till queendom come
Till queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come
Queendom come
My queendom come
I hunt the grounds for empathy
And hate the way it hides from me
With care and thirst I have become
You have a home in my queendom
You have a home in my queendom
You have a place in my queendom
You have a home
Till queendom come
Till queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come
