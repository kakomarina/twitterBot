I need some sleep
It can't go on like this
I tried countin' sheep
But there's one I always miss
Everyone says
I'm gettin' down too low
Everyone says
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
I need some sleep
Time to put the old horse down
I'm in too deep
And the wheels keep spinnin' 'round
Everyone says
I'm gettin' down too low
Everyone says
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
