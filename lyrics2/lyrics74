Laying in the silence
Waiting for the sirens
Signs, any signs I'm alive still
I don't wanna lose it
I'm not getting through this
Hey, should I pray
Should I fray, to myself
To a God, to a saviour
Who can
Unbreak the broken
Unsay these spoken words
Find hope in the hopeless
Pull me out the train wreck
Unburn the ashes
Unchain the reactions
I'm not ready to die not yet
Pull me out the train wreck
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out
Underneath our bad blood
We still got a sad song, home
Still at home, still at home
It's not too late to build it back
Coz a one in a million chances
Still a chance, still a chance
And I would take those odds
Unbreak the broken
Unsay these spoken words
Find hope in the hopeless
Pull me out the train wreck
Unburn the ashes
Unchain the reactions
I'm not ready to die, not yet
Pull me out the train wreck
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out
You can say what you like
Coz see I would die for you
I'm down on my knees
And I need you to be my guard
Be my help, be a saviour
Who can
Unbreak the broken
Unsay these reckless words
Find hope in the hopeless
Pull me out the train wreck
Unburn the ashes
Unchain the reactions
I'm not ready to die, not yet
Pull me out the train wreck
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out
Pull me out, pull me out
