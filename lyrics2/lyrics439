One, two
You ready?
Here we go
It ain't the gun
It's the man behind the trigger
Gets blood on his fingers
And runs
It ain't the lie
It's the way that the truth is denied
But if there is one thing that I'm guilty of
It's loving and giving when you take too much
If somebody asked how we died
Please look them straight in the eye
Call it suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them, baby
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know
It ain't the knife
It's the way that you use it
How you abuse it in fights
It ain't about the life
You feel you were given
As long as you're living in love
But if there is one thing that I'm guilty of
It's loving and giving when you take too much
If somebody asked how we died
You look them straight in the eye
Call it suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them, baby
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know
You've been killing me softly
And finally that is too much
And I'm all out of whiskey
To soak up the damage you've done
If there is anything I'm guilty of
It's loving you too much
If anybody asked how we died
Call it suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them, baby
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know
Call it suicide
Don't fabricate
Just tell them, baby
It was suicide
Don't sugarcoat it
Just let them know
