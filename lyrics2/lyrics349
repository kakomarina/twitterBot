Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us?
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train
New York City: it rains!
Fly to East L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
And if the world don't break
I'll be shaking it
Cuz I'm a young man after all!
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
Cuz I'm a young man built to fall!
Mind over matter
I'm in tatters thinking about her
Taste my disaster
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow
Tokyo snows
Go to watch the show
Curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time
And if the world don't break
I'll be shaking it
Cuz I'm a young man after all!
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
Cuz I'm a young man built to fall!
I missed that train
New York City: it rains!
Fly to East L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
All the lights aglow
Tokyo: snows
Go to watch the show; curtain's closed
I'm watching you this time
Mind over matter
Mind over matter
You know you're on my mind!
And if the world don't break
I'll be shaking it
Cuz I'm a young man after all!
And when the seasons change
I missed that train
Will you stand by me?
Fly to East L.A.
Cuz I'm a young man built to fall!
And if the world don't break!
All the lights aglow
Tokyo snows
Go to watch the show; curtain's closed
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
Cuz I'm a young man built to fall!
