When I was young and stupid
My love left to be a rock and roll star
He told me, please, don't worry
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one-way ticket
Out west, that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewelryâ€‹
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion
Bye-bye, baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the Sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost
Where I was from in NOLA
No one left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him, don't you blame me?
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust
He's chasing that pappy pipe dream
I know you don't but I
I know you don't but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone but I
That girl is gone but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit but maybe not
I feel so fucking numb
It hits my head and I feel numb
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
Bye-bye, baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the Sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost
