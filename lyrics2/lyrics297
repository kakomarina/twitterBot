Vacancy was lit, the guests were checking in
The concierge was cold
The water pipes had mold all over them
The room was fit for two
The bed was left in ruins
The neighbor was knocking, yeah
But no one would let him in
Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human
Dance into the night
A vodka and a sprite
A glimpse of the silhouettes
A night that they never forget
Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human
Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human
She sought death on a queen-sized bed
And he had said darling your looks can kill
So now youâ€™re dead
Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human
Touch me, yeah
I want you to touch me there
Make me feel like I am breathing
Feel like I am human again
