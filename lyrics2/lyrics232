It's a basic need to lie and be believed
Step out of line and you will have arrived
Oh, tell me something
Oh, don't say nothing
I'm gonna wait 'til it rains
Then I'm gonna burn everything
I'll sing to the clock because no one came
Oh, tell me something
Oh, don't say nothing
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like to be perfect
To be perfect
What it's like
Shine a light on a sob story
Shine it on the dust
This is the age of boredom and deadly weapons
Oh, flip a coin to live or die
Why are you so surprised
No one knows what it's like to be perfect
No one knows what it's like
Why are you so surprised
Flip a coin
Live or die
