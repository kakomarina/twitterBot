I'm sorry for everything
Oh, everything I've done
Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh, I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm going to mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishing I had what I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm going to mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
In the meantime can we let it go
At the roadside that we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bayside
Where you used to show
In the moonlight
Where we let it go
We can let this drift away, oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
I'm sorry for everything, oh everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
In the meantime can we let it go
At the roadside that we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bayside
Where you used to show
In the moonlight
Where we let it go
We can let this drift away, oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
