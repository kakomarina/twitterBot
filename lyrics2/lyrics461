The roman king, the Romulus
The precipice, born to change
The final days, the last embrace
Agustus, nero, taking names
I'm high, then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go

My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back
Bullet in a gun
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun
(Gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun)
Bullet in a gun
(Gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun)
Bullet in a gun

Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun
(Gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun)
Bullet in a gun
(Gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun)
Bullet in a-
