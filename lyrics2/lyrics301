I was three years old, all I wanted was the music
And my parents were doing everything they could
To move away from our place, working overtime always
While I sat up in my grandma's project building coloring
Oh, moved to a small town and started to, started to grow
Poetry written, I'm singing and dancing, oh
Photographs, painting, cartoons, that's all I know
That's all I know, oh
I have one best friend to this very fucking day
Since we were five years old and I fucking moved away
I wish I never did cause she's the only one who sees me
For who I really am instead of how many I reach
Oh, trusted too many fake people while I was still young
Gave them the benefit of the doubt, I was so wrong
I cut them off and they came for blood cause they know
They ain't getting no more
I'm so done with playing piggyback, ooh, ooh
Swear to God I wished y'all all the best, ooh
You're lying your way to try and gain a piece of me
When you could never come close, 'cause I know my destiny
I worked hard for my shit
Put my love in this shit
Now you're trying to kill my name for some fame
What is this?
Tried to help you do your shit
Encouraged you to work on it
Was a good friend and you used that to your advantage
Now I'm 22 and I've had a crazy year
Of isolation from all the plastic people here
I can not wait for the day, I can finally move away
Back to New York City where the realest people really stay
Oh, spent this whole time writing away my heart and my soul
The people I surround myself with have hearts filled with gold
Love and empathy are things that we hold so close
Trying to learn and evolve
I'm so done with playing piggyback, ooh, ooh
Swear to God I wished y'all all the best, ooh
You're lying your way to try and gain a piece of me
When you could never come close, 'cause I know my destiny
I worked hard for my shit
Put my love in this shit
Now you're trying to kill my name for some fame
What is this?
Tried to help you do your shit
Encouraged you to work on it
Was a good friend and you used that to your advantage
I'm so done with playing piggyback, ooh, ooh
Swear to God I wished y'all all the best, ooh
You're lying your way to try and gain a piece of me
When you could never come close, 'cause I know my destiny
