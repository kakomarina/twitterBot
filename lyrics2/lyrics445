You and me always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me always forever
Say you'll stay never be separate
You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I'll keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down
You and me always forever
We could stay alone together
Hard to say things could be better
Darling don't get away right now
You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I'll keep you in my locket
Just come here and we can settle down
Oh darling it's alarming thing to think of us apart
You know you've got me in your pocket
You don't just have to wait around
You know I'll keep you in my locket
Just come here and we could settle down
You and me always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me always forever
We could stay alone together
You and me always forever
We could stay alone together
