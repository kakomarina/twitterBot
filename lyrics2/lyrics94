So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sound
The rest I can do without
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You’ve intertwined your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
And c'mon, baby
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
And c'mon, baby
You said you'd find someone to take my place
I just don't believe that you have got it in you
'Cause we are just gonna keep doin' it and every time
I start to believe in anything you're saying
I'm reminded that I should be getting over it
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You’ve intertwined your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
(I don't want your body)
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul
'Cause we're never alone
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul
'Cause we're never alone
Got someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul
'Cause we're never alone
Got someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul
'Cause we're never alone
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You’ve intertwined your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else
(I don't)
(I don't)
(I don't)
(I don't)
(I don't)
(I don't)
(I don't)
(I don't)
(I don't)
(I don't)
(I don't)
(I don't)
