Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say: Baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin'
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't calling me baby
Why the sudden change
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say: Baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, my name
My name, my name
Any other day, I would call
You would say: Baby, how's your day?
But today, ain't the same
Any other word is uh-huh, yeah, okay
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
And if you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me, I'm the one that you claim
Why don't you say the things you said to me yesterday
I know that you said that I'm assuming things
If something's going down, that's the way it seems
It shouldn't be the reason why you actin' strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you said everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there, then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say: Baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin'
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't calling me baby
Why the sudden
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say: Baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game (oh, no)
Say my name, my name
(My name)
I know they say that some things are better left unsaid
And it wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
(Don't act like)
All of these things that people told me keep messing with my head
(My head)
You should've used honesty
Then you may not have blown it
But you don't have to say just what you did
I already know
I found out from him
Now there's just no chance for you and me
And will never be
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl I refused, you must got me confused
With some other guy
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn to cry
So cry me a river
Cry me a river, you sing
(Cry me a river)
You sing
(Cry me a river)
I sing hey
Yeah, yeah
You say, no, no
I say, yeah, yeah
You say, no, no
I say, yeah, yeah
You say, no, no
I say, yeah
Then you say, then you say my name
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say: Baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin'
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't calling me baby
Why the sudden
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say: Baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game (oh, no)
Say my name, my name
Say my name then cry me a river
(My name)
Say my name then cry me a river
(My name)
Say my name then cry me a river
