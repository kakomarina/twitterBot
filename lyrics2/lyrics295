One more day we'll spend together
Lay your eyes, look up upon me for the better
Oh, I know I'm worse for weather
But my love, I won't give up
Spend my days cursing my soul
Wishing I could paint my scars to make me whole
Oh, I know I could be better
But my love, I won't give up
I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one who keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the Sun, I'll be the waves
I'll be the one you love the most
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'll change my ways if you would stay
All your tears you have cried will go away
Oh, just grant me one more day
Oh, my love, please don't give up
I see the devil at my door
I see the future of the ones that I've ignored
I guess I was born to be at war
But my love, I won't give up
So, my love, please don't give up
I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one who keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the Sun, I'll be the waves
I'll be the one you love the most
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, hey, hey, hey (gonna be, gonna be)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your West Coast, honey (I get that feeling)
Ooh, hey, hey, hey (gonna be, gonna be)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be your West Coast, honey (I get that feeling)
