We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exulted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same
Gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance
I would take it
It's a shot in the dark
But I'll make it
Know with all of your heart
You can't shame me
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
We staked out on a mission
To find our inner peace
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
As long as we're together
There's no place I'd rather be
With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same
Gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance
I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart
You can't shame me
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be (yeah)
If you gave me a chance
I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart
You can't shame me
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you
There's no place I'd rather be
