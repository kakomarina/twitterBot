I can't focus on what needs to get done
I'm on notice hoping that you don't run
You think I'm tepid, but I'm misdiagnosed
'Cause I'm a stalker, I seen all of your posts
And I'm just trying to play it cool now
But that's not what I wanna do now
And I'm not tryna be with you now (you now)
You make it difficult to not overthink
And when I'm with you, I turn all shades of pink
I want to touch you, but don't want to be weird
It's such a rush, I'm thinking wish you were here
And I'm just trying to play it cool now
But that's not what I wanna do now
And I'm not tryna be with you now (you now)
But I could be your crush, like, throw you for a rush, like
Hoping you'd text me
So I could tell you I been thinking 'bout your touch like
Touch touch touch touch touch
I could be your crush crush crush crush crush
I got a fascination with your presentation
Making me feel like you're on my island
You're my permanent vacation
Touch touch touch touch touch
I could be your crush crush crush crush crush
I fill my calendar with stuff I can do
Maybe if I'm busy it could keep me from you
And I'm pretending you ain't been on my mind
But I took an interest in the things that you like
And I'm just trying to play it cool now
But that's not what I wanna do now
And I'm not tryna be with you now (you now)
But I could be your crush, like, throw you for a rush, like
Hoping you'd text me
So I could tell you I been thinking 'bout your touch like
Touch touch touch touch touch
I could be your crush crush crush crush crush
I got a fascination with your presentation
Making me feel like you're on my island
You're my permanent vacation
Touch touch touch touch touch
I could be your crush crush crush crush crush
And yeah, it's true that I'm a little bit intense, right
But can you blame me when you keep me on the fence, like?
And I been waiting hoping that you'd wanna text, like (text, like)
It's what I was born to do
And I'm just trying to play it cool now
But that's not what I want to do now
And I'm not trying to be with you now (you now)
But I could be your crush, like, throw you for a rush, like
Hoping you'd text me
So I could tell you I been thinking 'bout your touch like
Touch touch touch touch touch
I could be your crush crush crush crush crush
I got a fascination with your presentation
Making me feel like you're on my island
You're my permanent vacation
Touch touch touch touch touch
I could be your crush crush crush crush crush
