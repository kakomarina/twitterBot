About time for anyone telling you
Off for all your deeds
No sign the roaring thunder
Stopped in cold to read (no time)
Get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath (no time)
The Sun shines on everyone
Everyone love yourself to death
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved till you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
No lies and no deceiving
Man is what he loves
I keep tryin' to conceive that
Death is from above (no time)
I get mine and make no excuses
waste of precious breath (no time)
The Sun shines on everyone
Everyone love yourself to death
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved till you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
Life isn't always what you think it'd be
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong
But will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you?
Somehow, somehow?
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved till you've made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
A son of a
