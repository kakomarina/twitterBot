(Shake it up)
I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost
In the sounds
I hear in my mind
All these voices
I hear in my mind
All these words
I hear in my mind
All this music
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my ha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aart
And it breaks my ha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aart
Suppose I never ever met you
Suppose we never fell in love
Suppose I never ever let you
Kiss me so sweet
And so so-o-o-o-oft
Suppose I never ever saw you
Suppose you never ever called
Suppose I kept on singing love songs
Just to break
My own fall
Just to break my fa-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aall
Just to break my fa-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aall
Just to break my fa-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aall
Break my fall
Break my fall
All my friends say
That of course it's
Gonna get beh'uh
Gonna get beh'uh
Beh'uh, beh'uh, beh'uh, beh'uh
Behtur, bettur, betterrrr, ohhh...
I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost
In the sounds
I hear in my mind
All these voices
I hear in my mind
All these words
I hear in my mind
All this music
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
I hear in my mind
All of these voices
I hear in my mind
All of these words
I hear in my mind
All of this music
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
It breaks my ha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aart
And it breaks my ha, ah, ah, ah, art
And it breaks my ha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aart
And it breaks my heart
Breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
