We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passin' in the shadows
Lovin' the risk of bein' found
When we're caught in the headlights
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I was a faking alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And were caught in the headlights
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Dangerous
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Your love is always dangerous
Tell me that you love me
I don't know why
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
