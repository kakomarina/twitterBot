Don’t throw stones at me
Don’t tell anybody
Woah, woah, woah
Trouble finds me, woah
All the noise of this
Has made me lose my belief
Woah, woah, woah
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots
Had to lose my way
To know which road to take
Woah, woah, woah
Trouble found me, woah
All I look forward
Washed away by a wave
Woah, woah, woah
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots
I know it’s gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me
I know it’s gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I’m going back to my roots
