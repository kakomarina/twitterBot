Remember when we all got drunk?
I ended up with two broke thumbs
Oh my God, I felt so dumb
Lucky me
I wrote a song that no one knows
I played a show and no one showed
Oh my God, I felt so alone
Lucky me
(Woah) when all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
(Woah) what you gonna do? Who you gonna tell?
Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
Remember when she broke my heart
Waitin' for the waiter to return my card?
Right as I let down my guard
Lucky me
We had to work a bit more hard
Only just to get a little bit less far
We could laugh about it all tomorrow
Couldn't we?
(Woah) when all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
(Woah) what you gonna do? Who you gonna tell?
Maybe a hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
It goes like this
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you
A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories
A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties, yeah
No, I ain't scared of you
No, I ain't scared of you no more
