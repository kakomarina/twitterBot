I’ve been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringing me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo singing on my own
Now I can’t find a key without you
And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancing on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone
I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your Symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
I’m sorry if it’s all too much
Every day you’re here I’m healing
And I was running out of luck
I never thought I’d find this feeling
Cause I’ve been hearing symphonies
Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me (rhapsody for you and me)
And every melody is timeless
And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancing on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone
I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your Symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ah, ah
And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancing on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone
I feel incomplete
So if you want the truth
I just wanna be part of your Symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
