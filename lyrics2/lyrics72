Call it love and devotion
Call it the momâ€™s adoration (foundation)
A special bond of creation, hah
For all the single mums out there
Going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-Da-Paul, Anne-marie, sing, make them hear
She works the nights by the water
She's gone astray so far away from her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (daily struggle)
She tells him: Ooh love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you (stay out there, stay out there)
She tells him: Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life (straight)
You're gonna grow and have a good life
I'm gonna do what I've got to do (stay out there, stay out there)
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Rockabye, no (rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye) (oh)
Rockabye, yeah, yeah, oh (rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye)
Single mama you doing out there
Facing the hard life without no fear
Just so you know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come you well prepared (oh, no)
No mama, you never shed tear
'Cause you have to shed things year after year
And you give the youth love beyond compare
You find the school fee and the bus fare
Hmmmm Marie the pops' disappear
In the round back can't find him nowhere
Steadily you work flow, everything you know
So you nah stop no time, no time for your jear
Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe when she says
Ooh love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry (bidda-bang-bang-bang, alright then)
Rockabye, no (rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye) (oh)
Rockabye, yeah (rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye) (yeah)
Rockabye don't bother cry
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky, yo
Rockabye don't bother cry
Angels surround you, just dry your eye
