Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
For once he was a true love of mine
Tell him to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seam nor fine needlework
And he shall be the true love of mine
Tell him to wash it in yonder dry
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Where water sprung and rain never fell
And he shall be the true love of mine
Tell him to buy me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between salt water and the sea-sand
And then he'll be the true love of mine
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Remember me to the one who lives there
For once he was a true love of mine
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to the one who lives there
For once he was a true love of mine
For once he was a true love of mine
