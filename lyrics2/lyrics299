I went through hell to get to high water
And now I'm tryin' not drown
Each time I fail, it makes me try harder
I'll reach the stars next time around
I tripped and fell in the wishing well
I hit rock bottom, pennies kept landin' face down
Lost all I wanted, lookin' for will
Desire burnin' well
I went through hell, to get to high water
And now I'm tryin' not drown
Each time I fail, it makes me try harder
I'll reach the stars next time around
