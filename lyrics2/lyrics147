Looking at me through your window
Boy, you had your eye out for a little
I've cut you up and make you dinner
You've reached the end, you are the winner
Rolling down your tinted window
Driving next to me real slow, he said
Let me take you for a joyride
I've got some candy for you inside
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying: Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
He's saying: Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
Little bit of poison in me
I can taste your skin in my teeth
I love it when I hear you breathing
I hope to God you're never leaving
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, and pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying: Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
He's saying: Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
Eenie meenie miny mo
Catch a lady by her toes
If she screams, don't let her go
Eenie meenie miny mo
Your mother said to pick the very best girl
And I am
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand and pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand and pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it
Tag, tag, you're it
