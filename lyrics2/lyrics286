I have pinwheels in my eyes for you
Blinded by the pinks and blues
Oh, you were my wind-up Romeo
We had matching bubblegum tattoos
Serenade me with your kazoo
You tricked me with your ribbons
And your bow
It's so shinny in a shopping cart
Pretty in a parking lot
But when you go home
That's when it falls apart
I still think about you sometimes
Only when I walk through the 99 cent store
Aah, you sold me all those cheap lies
Could've built me a whole 99 cent store
Wine and dine me with yout plastic food
Robbed me of me sweet tooth
Help me up with a loaded water gun
Tied me to these toy train tracks
You left me there and you never came back
Tacky souvenirs when it's said and done
It's so shinny in a shopping cart
Pretty in a parking lot
But when you go home
That's when it falls apart
I still think about you sometimes
Only when I walk through the 99 cent store
Aah, you sold me all those cheap lies
Could've built me a whole 99 cent store
I still think about you sometimes
Only when I walk through the 99 cent store
Aah, you sold me all those cheap lies
Could've built me a whole 99 cent store
Ooh, ooh
I still think about you sometimes
Only when I walk through the 99 cent store
