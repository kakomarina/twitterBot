I know that you must feel like facing
With ruin, facing with ruin
I messed it up as always, I'm afraid of losing
I'm afraid of losing
I made you thinking oh so wrong
I made you feeling the worst
And I don't know how to get along
With myself when I'm weakened
When I'm weakened
So let's go back to our cocoon
On a blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On a blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Instead of you
I've been always playing solid as I'm waving
Solid as I'm waving
So I became a liar, I've been underrating
Overestimated
I made it really hard for you
Hard for you to love me
But there's so many things we could do
And all we need is escaping
Escaping
So let's go back to our cocoon
On a blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On a blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On a blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On a blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Instead of you
