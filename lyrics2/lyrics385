I just sort of always feel sick without you, baby
I ain’t got anything to lick without you, baby
Nothing seems to stick without you, baby
Ain’t I fallen in love
It’s just the pits without you, baby
It’s really just the pits without you, baby
It’s like everyone’s a dick without you, baby
Ain’t I fallen in love
And all my pals will tell me’s that I’m crazy
You bet I’m loopy alright!
And I just don’t recognize this fool
That you have made me
Whoa, I ain’t seen him for a while
And as your shrinking figure blows a kiss
I catch and smash it on my lips
Darling, I can’t seem to quit
Completely falling to bits
I really might be losing it
The idea that you’ve existed all along’s ridiculous
I don’t know what to say
Baby we ought to fuck
Seven years of bad luck out the powder room mirror
Could I have made it any clearer?
It’s love like a tongue in a nostril
Love like an ache in the jaw
You’re the first day of spring
With a septum piercing
Little miss sweet dreams, TN
