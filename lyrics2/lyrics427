All your life, no
You couldn't be mad about it
You've been sailing, sailing oh
You couldn't be sad about it
And it's been all this time
And you haven't lived without-out it
You are shining, shining it seems though
That your life, you've found it
No oh oh oh
But you've never
No, you've never seen the rain
No, oh oh oh
But you've never
No, you've never seen the rain
And it gets you down
But that's okay
You've been pushed 'round
You feel the pain
And when you fall
Just lean on me
'Cause you've never known
Never seen, never smelt, never felt
The rain
Rain' never felt the rain, rain, rain
It's a cold dark night and
No ones tryin' to find ya
You're just coasting, coasting by
'Cause nothing seems to mind ya
No, oh oh oh
But you've never
No, you've never seen the rain
No, oh oh oh
But you've never
No, you've never seen the rain
And it gets you down
But that's okay
You've been pushed 'round
You feel the pain
And when you fall
Just lean on me
'Cause you've never known
Never seen, never smelt, never felt
The rain
Rain' never felt the rain, rain, rain
And it gets you down
But that's okay
You've been pushed 'round
You feel the pain
And when you fall
Just lean on me
'Cause you've never known
Never seen, never smelt, never felt
The rain
Rain' never felt the rain, rain, rain
