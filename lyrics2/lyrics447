I've seen it risin', yeah, she got me shinin'
Oh, she really did like no one ever did
I've seen it fallin', yeah, she made the call
There's so much in between, you never can redeem
Just fly a little bit, oh, fly a little
Forever leavin' ground, amazement all around
Releasing', releasing'
When you're leaving'
Just don't let me down
I'm beggin' you
Just don't let me down
I'm beggin' you
I'm dreamin' of a dream that is never gonna end
Oh, you gotta see it, it'll treat you right
Just don't let me down
Heavenly
I've seen your wings when they're workin' when they're open
When they take you out, what they bring back home, and
I've seen this place when it's full of all the light that comes in
Between the moments', even if they're broken
And I was crawling with thoughts fallin' of pieces of things that we believed
Who are we to dream?
The wind was blowin', its made itself at home
But it's leavin' and you're leavin'
Just don't let me down
I'm begging you, begging you
Just don't let me down
I'm begging you, begging you
I'm dreamin' of a dream that is never gonna end
Oh, you gotta see it, it'll treat you right (treat you right)
Just don't let me down
Heavenly
There comes the day when I'm leaving
Oh, I'm begging you, don't let me down (don't let me down)
Treat me right, treat me right
Heavenly
Just don't let me down
I'm begging you, I'm begging you
Just don't let me down
I'm begging you, begging you
I'm dreamin' of a dream that is never gonna end
Oh, you gotta see it, it'll treat you right (treat you right)
Just don't let me down
Heavenly
