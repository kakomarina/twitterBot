Separate me from the rest of the herd so
I can run away from all of my hurt, oh
Drink what I want
Be what I want
Say what you want me to say like
I can pretend that I don’t wanna end, I’m afraid
(And dangerous)
Weave a story so I don’t have to talk, no
It’s not a problem if I never get caught, oh
Drink what I want
Be what I want
Say what you want me to say like
I can pretend that I don’t wanna end, I’m afraid
(And dangerous)
Oh, wishful drinkin'
Tell myself that I’m not thinkin' 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinkin', oh
(Hey)
Wishful drinkin'
Go ahead and stop your thinkin' now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinkin', oh
Hatch demons where no one can see 'em
Out of sight but in your mind you believe 'em
Drink what you want
Be what you want
Say what they want you to say like
I can pretend that I don’t wanna end, I’m afraid
Do you think, do you think that they notice?
I keep a bottle by my bed it's a focus
Drink what I want
Be what I want
Say what you want me to say like
I can pretend that I don’t wanna end, I’m afraid
(And dangerous)
Oh, wishful drinkin'
Tell myself that I’m not thinkin' 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinkin', oh
Wishful drinkin'
Go ahead and stop your thinkin' now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinkin', oh
This is not a problem if I don’t want it to stop
Can’t call it a problem if I never let a play drop
This is not a problem if convincin' that it’s not
Don’t call it a problem, it’s the only thing that I still got
Hey, oh
Hey, I know
Down, down, down
Wishful drinkin', oh
Oh, wishful drinkin'
Tell myself that I’m not thinkin' 'bout
How I could drown, drown, drown, drown
Wishful drinkin', oh
Wishful drinkin'
Go ahead and stop your thinkin' now
And throw it down, down, down, down
Wishful drinkin', oh
