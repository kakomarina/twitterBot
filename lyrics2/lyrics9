Write this down baby
I'm not physically fulfilled
You've never held it down all night
And you're selfish cuz' you always think your ass is always right
And you never see the lesson when it's right in front your eyes
Are you writing this shit down cause' because baby boy I think it's time
Tell me you learned a thing or two
Bout' how to keep a girl like me with you
Tell me you learned how to switch it up
I'm tired of running to you just give up
'Cause I didn't sign up for this
Had to make it ten times more than you
When I sacrificed blood for you
I sacrificed blood
Write this shit in your notebook, baby
Sincе you never wrote lovе letters to me, to me
Don't forget all the things I taught you
You'll need it for someone who isn't me, ain't me
What's the point in your I love you's
When they don't hold any weight
You touch your computer much more than you ever touched me
Every night you come at home then you just go right to sleep
Laying next to just a friend who occasionally fucks me
Tell me now just how I feel?
Since you told me you'll wait forever
Time you start growing up
It's just nothing if your not involved
Dear I didn't have time for this but I still gave you my all
I sacrificed blood for you
I sacrificed blood
Write this shit in your notebook, baby
Since you never wrote love letters to me, to me
Don't forget all the things I taught you
You'll need it for someone who isn't me, ain't me
