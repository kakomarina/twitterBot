I'm wasted, losing time
I'm a foolish, fragile spine
I want all that is not mine
I want him but we're not right
In the darkness I will meet my creators
And they will all agree, that I'm a suffocator
I should go now quietly
For my bones have found a place
To lie down and sleep
Where all my layers can become reeds
All my limbs can become trees
All my children can become me
What a mess I leave
To follow
To follow
To follow
To follow
In the darkness I will meet my creators
And they will all agree, that I'm a suffocator
Oh, love
I'm sorry if I smothered you
I'm sorry if I smothered you
I sometimes wish I'd stayed inside
My mother
Never to come out
