I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
In a dark room
In cold sheets
I can't feel
A damn thing
I lost myself
Between your legs
Your medicine
Is in my head
You know I'd rather be alone
But then you call me on the phone
Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go
Yeah
I tell myself
I like that
When you tie my hands
Behind my back
You're confident
I'll give you that
But if you love yourself
You can fuck yourself
'Cause I'd rather be alone
But you're fermented in my bones
Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go
Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go
(Habits of my heart)
(I can't say no)
(It's ripping me apart)
(You get too close)
