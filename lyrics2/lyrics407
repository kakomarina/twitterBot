A couple rebel Top Gun pilots flying with nowhere to be, oh
Don't know you super well, but I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally
Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome, right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
See me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off, know I think you're awesome, right?
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Might get your friend to drive, but he can hardly see, oh
We'll end up painted on the road, red and chrome, all the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
See me rolling, showing someone else love
Hands under your T-shirt, know I think you're awesome, right?
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Now you know it's really gonna blow
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
