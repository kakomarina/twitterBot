Your skin is warm like an oven
Your kiss is sugary sweet
Your fingers feel like cotton
When you put your arms around me
I feel like I'm just missing
Something whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients
Except you loving me
And respectfully
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night
You smell just like vanilla
You taste like buttercream
You're filling up my senses
With empty calories
I feel like I'm just missing
Something whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients
Except you needing me
So respectfully
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night
If I'm just a piece of cake
I'm just a piece of cake
Then you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me
If I'm just a piece of cake
I'm just a piece of cake
Then you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night
The slice of heaven that I gave
The slice of heaven that I gave to you
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night
