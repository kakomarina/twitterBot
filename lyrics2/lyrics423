Take a look around the room
Love comes wearing disguises
How to go about and choose
Break it down by shapes and sizes
I'm a man who's got very specific taste
You're, you're, you're just my type
You got a pulse and you are breathing
You're, you're, you're just my type
I think it's time that we get leaving
You're, you're, you're just my type
When there's loving in the air
Don't fight it just keep breathing
I can't help myself but stare
Double check for double meanings
I'm a man who's got very specific taste
You're, you're, you're just my type
You got a pulse and you are breathing
You're, you're, you're just my type
I think it's time that we get leaving
You're, you're, you're just my type
You're, you're, you're just my type
You got a pulse and you are breathing
You're, you're, you're just my type
I think it's time that we get leaving
You're, you're, you're just my type
