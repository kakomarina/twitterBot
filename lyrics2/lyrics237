First thing first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way
That things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
Singing my heart ache to my brain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty in the pain
Pain
You make me a, you make me a believer, believer
Pain
You take me up, you break me down, believer, believer
Pain
I let the bullets fly, I let them rain
My luck, my love, my God, they came from
Pain
You make me a, you make me a believer, believer
Third things third
All the prayer to the people above
All the hate that you've seen
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit to a above, oh-ooh
I was choking in the crowd
Living my heart up in the cloud
Falling to ashes on the ground
Hoping to drown, into the pain
Pain!
You make me a, you make me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me up, you break me down, believer, believer
Pain
Make the bullets fly, I let them rain
My luck, my love, my God, they came from
Pain
You make me a, you make me a believer, believer
You're the face of the future
You're the blood in my veins
You're the face of the future
You're the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
Pain
You make me a, you make me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me up, you break me down, believer, believer
Pain
I let the bullets fly, I let them rain
My luck, my love, my God, it came from
Pain
You make me a, you make me a believer, believer
