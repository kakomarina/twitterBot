Here I am tied and bound
Every night feeling low
Bad days come back whatever
In the sun I bathe, in everyday light
You draft me down for a split second tomorrow
What am I supposed to do
I know you would make me happy
Girl I found my way out
I found it at last, now I'm sober
Wouhouwhou
Let's go
Hey (whouhouwhou)
Hey
You cryin'
How sweet the sound
Silence's on, I attempt
Bow and scrape, tope the line
Never get back together
With the same old style rand down my life
You drag and drop, attract me after all
Anyway I'm gone tomorrow
I know you would make me happy
Girl I found my way out
I found it at last, now I'm sober
I know it would make it concrete
Now you're cryin'
(Whouhouwhou)
How sweet the sound
Let's go
Hey!
(Whouhouwhouwhou)
Let's go
Hey
You cryin'
How sweet the sound
Hey
Let's go
We're back to back for hours
We're weak and what they say
'Bout loving like we do
We'll never give this up
You cryin'
How sweet the sound
