I don’t know why
I can’t quite
Get you out my sight
You’re always just behind
Each thought across my mind
Keep crawling back
To where we last
Left our love on hold
I’m always out for more
So what you waiting for
Wait before you burn me to the ground
Please stay until the beat of my heart runs out
I don’t wanna let go let go
Cus I been tryin’a hold on for too long
I feel like I’m lost without a trace
Take my heart and runaway
She said, I’ve been looking for a lasting lover
To save me, to save me
From every single heartache heartache
I feel like I’m lost without a trace
Take my heart and runaway
And she said, I’ve been looking for a lasting lover
One by one now
And two by twice
I’ve watched all my loves
Move on to something more
Up and out the door
Caught in between every passing hour
Oh please stay, til the taste in your mouth turns sour
I don’t wanna let go let go
Cus I been tryin’a hold on for too long
I feel like I’m lost without a trace
Take my heart and runaway
She said, Ive been looking for a lasting lover
To save me, to save me
From every single heartache heartache
I feel like I’m lost without a trace
Take my heart and runaway
And she said, I’ve been looking for a lasting lover
I’ve been looking for a lover
let me know
Did we ever mean anything at all
So let me know
Can we ever mean anything at all
I feel like I’m lost without a trace
Take my heart and runaway
She said,
I feel like I’m lost without a trace
Take my heart and runaway
She said,
Ive been looking for a lasting lover
