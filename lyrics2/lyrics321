And meet me there, with bundles of flowers
We'll wade through the hours of cold winter
She'll howl at the walls
Tearing down doors of time
Shelter as we go
And promise me this
You'll wait for me only
Scared of the lonely arms
Surface, far below these words
And maybe, just maybe I'll come home
Who am I, darling to you?
Who am I
Going to tell you stories of mine?
Who am I?
Who am I, darling for you?
Who am I
Could to be your burden in time? Lonely
Who am I, to you?
Who am I, darling for you?
Who am I?
Going to be your burden
Who am I, darling to you?
Who am I?
I come alone here
I come alone here
