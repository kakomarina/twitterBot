Here, I'll forgive my thoughts now
Steer it, â€˜cause I forget the dots now
Was it all any more faded after all?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Are you sure, did you call?
Did we ever really talk?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't
Dear, I wouldn't bet your heart down
Clear, but I couldn't get my head around
Was it all any more faded after all?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Are you sure, did you call?
Did we ever really talk?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I've been awake in every state line
Dying to make it last us a lifetime
Trying to shake that it's all on an incline
Find me a way
I'll be yours in a landslide!
