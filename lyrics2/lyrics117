It was the middle of class and the teacher wasn't lookin'
Kelly had a fat ass and trouble was cookin'
She had a boy wrapped around her finger tight
I fell in love with him but he wasn't in my life
The teacher gave me notes to go out and give Kelly
She was kissin' Brandon and I got jelly
I wanted to be in her shoes for one day
I just waited 'til recess to make her pay
Mommy, why do I feel sad?
Should I give him away or feel this bad?
No, no, no, don't you choke
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
(Class fight)
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
(Class fight)
Her face was fucked up and my hands were bloody
We were in the playground, things were getting muddy
The teacher broke us up after I broke her
And my one true love called me a monster
Mommy, why do I feel sad?
Should I give him away or feel this bad?
No, no, no, don't you choke
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
(Class fight)
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in: Go for the throat
(Class fight)
