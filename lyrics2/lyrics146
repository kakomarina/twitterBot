I don't care if it hurts
I'll pay my weight in blood
To feel my nerves wake up
So love me now or let me go
Let me feel these high and lows
Before the doors to my heart close
Touch me someone
I'm too young to feel so
Numb, numb, numb, numb
You could be the one to
Make me feel something, something
Make me feel something, something
Show me that you're human, ohh
Make me feel something, something
I never thought I'd miss the bittersweet
I gave those years away
And lost my sense of taste
'Cause all of your lovers eventually fade
And leave you alone in the bed you made
And all of the colors that bleed to gray leave nothing
Touch me someone
I'm too young to feel so
Numb, numb, numb, numb
So give me just enough to
Make me feel something, something
Make me feel something, something
Show me that you're human, ohh
Make me feel something, something
So if you're gonna stay, then stay
But if you're gonna go
Make sure that you hurt me just enough to
Make me feel something, something
Make me feel something, something
Show me that I'm human, ohh
Make me feel something, something
Make me feel something, something
