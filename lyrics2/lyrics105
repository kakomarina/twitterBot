From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you
Now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is going to bring us to our knees
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
And I'll be me?
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
And I'll be me?
Trying fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make me feel right, no
Whoa
Trying push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
And I'll be me?
