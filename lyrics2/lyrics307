So sentimental
Not sentimental no!
Romantic not disgusting yet
Darling, I'm down and lonely
When where the fortunate only?
I've been looking for something else
Do let do let do let jugulate do let do let do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
Distant from other interests
On your favorite weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
That's with the fortunate only
No I gotta be someone else
These days it comes it comes it comes
It comes it comes and goes
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh!
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh!
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses
Follow, misguide, stand still
Disgust, discourage
On this precious weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
Wealthiest gentlemen only
And now that you're lonely
Do let do let do let jugulate do let do let do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
We'll burn the pictures instead
When it's all over we can barely discuss
For one minute only
Not with the fortunate only
Thought it could have been something else
These days it comes it comes it comes
It comes it comes and goes
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh!
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh!
I'm not easily offended
It's not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses
It's show time, it's show time, it's show time
Hmmmm
It's show time, it's show time, it's show time
Time, time to show love
Time to show love, it's time to show love
Time, time to show love
Time to show love, it's time to show love
From a mess to the masses
Lisztomania
Think less, but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh!
