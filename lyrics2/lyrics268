One, two
Melatonin is coming for you
Three, four
Baby, won't you lock the door?
Five, six
I'm done with it
Seven, eight
It's getting late
So close your eyes
Sleep for days
Hush, little baby
Drink your spoiled milk
I'm fucking crazy
Need my prescription filled
Do you like my cookies?
They're made just for you
A little bit of sugar
But lots of poison too
Ashes,ashes, time to go down
Oooh honey, do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore
Need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby
Where you die at the end
Nine, ten
Never want to see you again
Eleven, twelve
I pull off black so well
Shit behind the curtain
That I'm sick of sugarcoatin'
Next time you're alone
Think fast when you grab the phone
Ashes,ashes, time to go down
Oooh honey, do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore
Need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby
Where you die at the end
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Oooh honey, do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore
Need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby
Where you die at the end
