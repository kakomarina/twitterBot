Merrily we fall
Out of line, out of line
I’d fall anywhere with you
I’m by your side
Swinging in the rain
Humming melodies
We're not going anywhere until we freeze
I’m not afraid, anymore
I’m not afraid
Forever is a long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side
Carefully we'll place our destiny
You came and you took this heart, and set it free
Every word you write or sing
Is so warm to me, so warm to me
I’m torn, I’m torn to be right where you are
I’m not afraid, anymore
I’m not afraid
Forever is a long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side
Tell me everyday I get to wake up to that smile
I wouldn't mind it at all
I wouldn't mind it at all
You so know me
Pinch me gently
I can hardly breathe
Forever is a long, long time
But I wouldn't mind spending it by your side
Tell me everyday I get to wake up to that smile
I wouldn't mind it at all
I wouldn't mind it at all
