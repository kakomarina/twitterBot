I was hoping for an indication
I was seeking higher elevation
I've been shaken wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin' hiding from the spotlight
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)
Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
I was there but I was always leaving
I believe it, that I was never breathing
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh it's calling out and I won't walk away
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up)
I'm bursting like the 4th of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)
I would always open up the door
Always looking up at higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for the making changes
Walking down the street and meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)
