Well you’re not what I was looking for
But your arms were open at my door
And you taught me what a life is for
To see that ordinary, isn’t
Light me up again
Light me up again
And I want to keep us all alive
And I want to see you with my eyes
But I see you in the fireflies
And how extraordinary is that
Light me up again
Light me up again
And you don’t hold back
So I won’t hold back
And you don’t look back
So I won’t look back
Light me up again
Light me up again
We are, we are, we are tonight
We are, we are, we are forever
And you don’t hold back
So I won’t hold back
And you don’t look back
So I won’t look back
Light me up again
Light me up again
And you don’t hold back
So I won’t hold back
And you don’t look back
So I won’t look back
Light me up again
Light me up again
We are, we are, we are tonight
We are, we are, we are forever
