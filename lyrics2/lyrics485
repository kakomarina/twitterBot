Pinky promise I'll still love your garden
Even with no flowers, even with no flowers
Doctor's orders, don't be broken hearted
Time will still be ours, time will still be ours
Never thought that something
Something so tragic could ever happen to
Our peaceful little perfect family
I promise, promise to love you
You and the children, carousel spinnin'
Our neighborhood will always be this pretty
Bombs are fallin' on Monday morning
Waitin' for the news, together
An explosion, any moment
You make moments last, forever and ever
You make moments last forever
Eyes like hazel, twinkle in the starlight
Even when they're crying, even when they're crying
Constellations formin' out of scar lines
Even when they're dyin', love will still be tryin'
Never thought that something
Something so tragic could ever happen to
Our peaceful little perfect family
I promise, promise to love you
You and the children, carousel spinnin'
Our neighborhood will always be this pretty
Bombs are fallin' on Monday morning
Waitin' for the news, together
An explosion, any moment
You make moments last, forever and ever
You make moments last forever
Bombs are fallin' on Monday morning
Bombs are fallin', you make moments last forever
Bombs are fallin' on Monday morning
Waitin' for the news, together
An explosion, any moment
You make moments last, forever and ever
Bombs are fallin' on Monday morning
Bombs are fallin', you make moments last forever
You make moments last forever
