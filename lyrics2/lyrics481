Walking in my sleep
Like the naked trees
Will they wake up again?
Do they sleep, do they dream?
Feel it as the wind strokes my skin
I am moved by the chill
Hear the winter bird sing
My tears are always frozen
I can see the air I breathe
Got my fingers painting pictures
On the glass in front of me
Lay me by the frozen river
Where the boats have passed me by
All I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive
Silent days, violent chase
We are dancing again
In a dream, by the lake
My tears are always frozen
I can see the air I breathe
Got my fingers painting pictures
On the glass in front of me
Lay me by the frozen river
Where the boats have passed me by
All I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive
Pressed against my pillow
Like the ageing winter Sun
Only wake each morning
To remember that you're gone
So I drift away again
To winter I belong
My tears are always frozen
I can see the air I breathe
Got my fingers painting pictures
On the glass in front of me
Lay me by the frozen river
Where the boats have passed me by
All I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive
My tears are always frozen
My tears are always frozen
My tears are always frozen
All I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive
I need is to remember
How it was to feel alive
