Savor the taste
Savor the pain
I don't expect you to release me
Jumping the gun
Holding my tongue
I'd never ask you to forgive me
And you will never see my side
And I will always think I'm right
But I always regret the night
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever (oh, oh)
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
Playing the part
Playing the game
I don't expect you to believe me
Missing the mark
We tear it apart
I'd never ask you why you need me
And you will never see my side
And I will always think I'm right
But I always regret the night
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever (oh, oh)
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
What else should I say?
What else could I do?
Maybe it's too much for you
What else should I say?
What else could I do?
Maybe I am just too much for you
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever (oh, oh)
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
