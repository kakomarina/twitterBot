All my life been sitting at the table
Watching them kids their living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a’wishin
But now it’s about time to raise up and petition
All my life, been sitting at the table
Watching them kids and living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a’wishin
Now it's 'bout time to stand up and petition
Cause I’ve been wondering
When you’re gonna see I’m not for sale?
I’ve been questioning
When you’re gonna see I’m not a part of your machine?
Not a part of your machine
I’m not scared of what you’re gonna tell me
No, I’m not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision
I’m not scared of what you’re gonna tell me
And I’m not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision
Cause I’ve been wondering
When you’re gonna see I’m not for sale?
I’ve been questioning
When you’re gonna see I’m not a part of your machine?
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine
I am the machine
Cause I’ve been wondering
When you’re gonna see I’m not for sale?
I’ve been questioning
When you’re gonna see I’m not a part of your machine?
Not a part of your machine
Cause I’ve been wondering
When you’re gonna see I’m not for sale?
I’ve been questioning
When you’re gonna see I’m not a part of your machine?
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine
