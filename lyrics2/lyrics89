One, two, three, four
Woah
Haha
Oh na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na
I trade the whip out for a bike
Designer for some Nikes
Switch the stripper for a wife
Black tie for a white T
I've been moving lightspeed, lightspeed
Lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed
Lightspeed, lightspeed, lightspeed
Look, I don't want to try
Keep it cool like ice tea
So if I seem shy
It's 'cause you seem so shiesty
Sellin' what you buy, buy, buy
Just a product of the 90's
If you close your eyes
That's where you'll find me
I'm the devil's advocate
You don't know the half of it
Good luck tryna manage it
If a God is a dog, and a man is a fraud, then I'm a lost cause
22's on the ride (ride)
Bring me back a five piece (five)
Same ticket for the rent, yeah
But I split it with a dime piece
Married to my friends
They don't always like me
I stay together for the kids
Gotta do the right thing
I'm the devil's advocate
You don't know the half of it
Good luck tryna manage it
If a God is a dog, and a man is a fraud, then I'm a lost cause
