I've been trying to do it right
I've been living a lonely life
I've been sleepin' here instead
I've been sleepin' in my bed
Sleepin' in my bed
So show me family
All the blood that I will bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet
I don't think you're right for him
Think of what it might have been if we
Took a bus to Chinatown
I'd be standin on Canal and Bowery
And she'd be standin next to me
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
Love, we need it now
Let's hope for some
'Cause oh, we're bleedin' out
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet
