Sometimes I feel like throwing
My hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying
"Lord I just don't care"
You've got the love I need
To see me through
Sometimes it seems
That the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems
That life is just too much
You've got the love I need
To see me through
When food is gone you are my daily need
When friends are gone
I know my savior's love is real
Your love is real
You've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love
Time after time I think
"Oh Lord what's the use?"
Time after time I think it's just no good
Sooner or later in life
The things you love you lose
You got the love I need
To see me through
You've got the love,
You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love,
You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love,
You've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love,
You've got the love, you've got the love
Sometimes I feel like throwing
My hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying
"Lord I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need
To see me through
