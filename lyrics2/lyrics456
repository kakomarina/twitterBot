Well maybe I'm a crook
For stealing your heart away
Yeah maybe I'm a crook
For not caring for it
Yeah, maybe I'm a bad, bad, bad... bad person
Well baby I know
And these fingertips
Will never run through your skin
And those bright blue eyes
Can only meet mine
Across a room filled with people
That are less important than you
'Cause you love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love you
So I think it's best
We both forget
Before we dwell on it
The way you held me so tight
All through the night
'till it was near morning
'Cause you love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love you
'Cause you love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love
You love, love, love
When you know I can't love you
