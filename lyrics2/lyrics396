I'm coming up only to hold you under
I'm coming up only to show you wrong
And to know you is hard and we wonder
To know you, all wrong we were
Really too late to call, so we wait for
Morning to wake you; it's all we got
To know me as hardly golden
Is to know me, all wrong they were
At every occasion I'll be ready for a funeral
At every occasion once more is called a funeral
Every occasion I'm ready for the funeral
At every occasion one brilliant day funeral
I'm coming up only to show you down for
I'm coming up only to show you wrong
To the outside, the dead leaves, they all blow (alive is very poetic)
For'e (before) they died had trees to hang their hope
At every occasion I will be ready for the funeral
At every occasion once more it's called the funeral
At every occasion oh I'm ready for the funeral
At every occasion of one billion day funeral
