Oh, I beg you
Can I follow?
Oh, I ask you
Why not always?
Be the ocean where I unravel
Be my only, be the water
And I'm wading
You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea, baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark doom, honey
I follow you
He a message, I'm the runner
He's the rebel, I'm the daughter
Waiting for you
You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea, baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark doom, honey
I follow you
You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea, baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark doom, honey
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea, baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark doom, honey
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea, baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark doom, honey
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea, baby
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark doom, honey
I follow you
