So, this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent?
And now it’s time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top, don’t hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check
I don’t ever wanna let you down
I don’t ever wanna leave this town
‘Cause, after all
This city never sleeps at night
It’s time to begin, isn’t it?
I get a little bit bigger
But then, I’ll admit
I’m just the same as I was
Now, don’t you understand?
That I’m never changing who I am
So, this is where you fell, and I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top, don’t look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain-check
I don’t ever wanna let you down
I don’t ever wanna leave this town
‘Cause, after all
This city never sleeps at night
It’s time to begin, isn’t it?
I get a little bit bigger
But then, I’ll admit
I’m just the same as I was
Now, don’t you understand?
That I’m never changing who I am
It’s time to begin, isn’t it?
I get a little bit bigger
But then, I’ll admit
I’m just the same as I was
Now, don’t you understand?
That I’m never changing who I am
This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn’t burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes
It’s time to begin, isn’t it?
I get a little bit bigger
But then, I’ll admit
I’m just the same as I was
Now, don’t you understand?
That I’m never changing who I am
It’s time to begin, isn’t it?
I get a little bit bigger
But then, I’ll admit
I’m just the same as I was
Don’t you understand?
That I’m never changing who I am
